As the youngest of Bill and ex-wife Melinda's three children, Phoebe Gates doesn't have a ton of experience, but she plans on carving her own path in life.</p><p>It's safe to say that she has already begun taking strides toward her independence. Phoebe graduated from The Julliard School after studying art and is an aspiring designer who has been stepping into the world of fashion. She recently made appearances at the New York and Paris Fashion Week shows, and is becoming a viral social media star with other 300,000 followers on Instagram. Let's take a closer look at what Phoebe Gates does for a living and if she makes enough money to stand on her own two feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-phoebe-gates-do-for-a-living>What Does Phoebe Gates Do For A Living?</h2><p>Following Phoebe Gate's 21st birthday in September 2023, fans became curious about how the billionaire heiress can support herself. Of course, Bill Gates' has a whopping $110 billion net worth, and his ex-wife, Melinda, is worth $10.3 billion, according to Forbes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-phoebe-gates-really-feels-about-having-a-billionaire-for-a-father-1.jpg><p>However, Phoebe has been clear that while she understands the immense privilege that comes with being their daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's not letting their wealth define her.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Phoebe Gates Really Feels About Having A Billionaire For A Father</a></span></p><p>That being said, Pheobe has been busy making waves in the world of fashion. She has rubbed shoulders at a few elite parties with some of the biggest names in modeling and entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few of these names include television personality and model<a href=#> Tyra Banks, who made a fortune on Dancing with the Stars,</a> TIME Magazine editor Lucy Feldman, and Canadian fashion designer Aurora James.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5.png><p>Pheobe Gates even landed and internship at British Vogue, so she's in the right company of people to take her fashion designing aspirations to the next level. But it's not so surprising that she has such easy access to these celebrities when you consider who her parents are and the kind of wealth she's born into.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phoebe has made certain to keep posting beautiful selfies of her striking poses on Instagram and TikTok as a way of promoting her love for fashion. Her accounts are flooded with photos of her with friends enjoying extravagant trips in all areas around the globe.</p><p>Besides fashion design and modeling, she also has another love that she enjoys sharing with the world - feminism. Like her mother, Melinda, and many other Hollywood celebrities and elites, Phoebe has fiercely expressed her advocacy for women's rights, speaking on issues such as Roe v. Wade abortion ban and voters' rights. She even shared a photo on Instagram of an interview she had with Vogue Magazine in July 2022 on the "Global Stakes of the End of Roe v. Wade."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Bill Gates' Youngest Daughter, Phoebe Adele Gates?</a></span></p><p>But the ambitious and outspoken daughter of the billionaire tech mogul hasn't stopped there. Just last month, she and her roommate at Stanford University, Sophia Kianni, collaborated with luxury <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">English fashion designer, Stella McCartney</a>, to promote their limited-edition purse collection.

The platform is being described as being "the future of fashion," so customers will have to wait and see if her father's expertise in software user experience shined through on the app.</p><h2 id=what-is-phoebe-gates-39-net-worth>What Is Phoebe Gates' Net Worth?</h2><p>While it's assumed that being born to ultra-rich parents means that you'll automatically receive an enormous inheritance, some parents do their children a favor by not making life so easy. As an added measure of their unconventional parenting style, Bill and Melinda Gates have agreed to leave <a href=#>a modest inheritance to their children</a> - each receiving $10 million.</p><p>That's far from average for the average white-collar worker, but given their multi-billion-dollar fortune, that amount can be seen as mere pennies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1.png><p>With Phoebe's net worth at $20 million, according to Forbes, we can say that she's been definitely making moves of her own that have been paying off. She may not be anywhere close to the individual net worth of her parents as yet, but let's hope that her business endeavors yield the kind of success she hopes to attain in life.</p><h2 id=inside-phoebe-gates-39-lavish-childhood>Inside Phoebe Gates' Lavish Childhood</h2><p>Before the news of the divorce of Bill and Melinda Gates was headlined internationally in 2021, the couple enjoyed twenty-seven years of marriage together, out of which came three children. Despite their elite global status and accumulation of affluence, they were vocal about doing the utmost to give their children a normal childhood. But when you're the child of Bill and Melinda Gates, it's hard not to notice that you're way more privileged than the average child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/this-is-what-phoebe-gates-really-does-for-a-living-and-if-she-makes-enough-money-to-stand-on-her-own-two-feet.jpg><p>But her parents seemed to care enough not to allow their children to grow up spoiled or entitled. They made them split house chores frequently to learn a sense of responsibility. And Bill even admitted to not permitting his children to own a cell phone until they were fourteen years old. As a software inventor, he must have his reasons for not wanting them hooked on the screens too early.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Phoebe Adele Gates' Relationship With Her Siblings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, even with stringent measures in place, it was undoubtedly impossible for Phoebe to miss the massive mansion she inhabited as a child. Her parents' attempt at instilling a modest lifestyle was a challenge when the family lived in a $131 million palace that Bill named Xanadu 2.0. The behemoth building came equipped with seven bedrooms, twenty-four bathrooms, six kitchens, an indoor cinema, gym, trampoline room, a 60-foot swimming pool, and a 475-foot artificial beach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr2pu8SbnGafkamytHnDqJysZZakv26tjKWgr6GenHq0rcuaqbJlkp65rXnGmqueq12Zrrazx62cq2c%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./former-vogue-journalist-and-antm-judge-andre-leon-talley-dies-at-73.html>&#171;&nbsp;Former Vogue Journalist and ANTM Judge Andre Leon Talley Dies at 73</a>
