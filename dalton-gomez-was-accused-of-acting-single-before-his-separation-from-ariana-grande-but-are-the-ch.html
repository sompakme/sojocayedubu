Especially when the stars are as young and hot as Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez. Their July 2023 separation announcement also came out of nowhere, suggesting that drama happened behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a blind source on Deux Moi, the source of this drama may have been Dalton Gomez seeing other women on the side.

Meaning that they can spread a lot of phony information. However, they also get some leads that have been proven somewhat accurate. This includes <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White's separation from his wife Addison Timlin</a>.

Still, the source's experience with Dalton Gomez at an unnamed Hollywood party caused a stir amongst Deux Moi's 1.9 million followers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Did Ariana Grande's Friends Think Of Dalton Gomez Before Their Split After 2 Years Of Marriage?</a></span></p><p>"So back in March [2023], I attended an event where there were a bunch of celebrities.
