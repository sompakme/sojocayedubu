Shoppers say they chose this robe for a variety of key reasons. First and foremost, it’s very affordable, the quality and the feel of the material is reportedly excellent and there are plenty of color options to choose from. One reviewer called this robe ‘lightweight,’ but claims it still feels ‘warm and cozy’ at the same time.<p>And on top of that, the size options this robe currently offers are outstanding! In many cases, specifically with robes that are fairly simple like this one, you’ll find a one-size-fits all situation when it comes time to purchase, but here, you’ll be able to get the right size to fit you properly.</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>#1 Bestseller</li><li>Affordable</li><li>Great color and size options</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Polyester material</li><li>Not the best for post-bath</li><li>Slightly shorter length</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-09-at-3.57.25-PM-1.png></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$148</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>Comfort is key when shopping for a robe, and that’s where Barefoot Dreams comes in. Of the brand’s vast selection, the CozyChic Ultra Lite long robe is a hit for multiple reasons. First, its machine-washable microfiber yarn doesn’t shrink or pill (a common problem with robes). Additionally, it will provide ample warmth —&nbsp;but its nylon/rayon mix will keep you cool at the same time.<p>Yes, this is a longer robe, so petite shoppers may be weary it will extend too far down. This is a valid concern, but reviewers of all sizes praise the product. Shoppers have called it ‘the best investment ever,’ and compare it to wearing one of Barefoot Dreams’ sumptuous blankets. Don’t let the price tag deter you, as it’s an investment worthy of your closet.</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Popular brand</li><li>Incredibly soft</li><li>Convenient microfiber material</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>More expensive than other options</li><li>Some sizes selling out fast</li><li>May be too long for petite shoppers</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3105QJ2wfL._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$35</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>If you’re shopping for the best bathrobes for women or looking to invest in a gift for a couple (or hoping to match your significant other), this popular Biolinen robe may be the top pick. It’s made from 100% organic cotton, which instantly gives it an edge compared to others. It’s generously sized and unisex, so it may not fit every shopper —&nbsp;but Amazon reviewers are thrilled with the fit and feel, dubbing it a ‘soft walking towel.’<p>Being absorbent is a crucial feature for many of the best robes for women, and this is a prime example of a functional pick that still has fashion credibility thanks to its sleek design. For a full ensemble, they are available with matching slippers. It’s truly the best gifting option around!</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Unisex sizing</li><li>Absorbent material</li><li>Fair price</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>May be too big for petite shoppers</li><li>Only one color option available</li><li>The white shade may get dirty faster</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31xTFNKn2BL._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$100</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>If you want a robe that will make you feel like you’re waking up in a luxurious 5-star hotel every day, this is the robe for you! The lining on the interior is made from a luxe microfiber material, which is what you’re truly investing in. Unlike other fabrics, microfiber has the ability to absorb moisture super quickly and it won’t feel like you’re wearing a soaking wet towel.<p>Buying a microfiber robe may be more of an expense, but we’re confident that a robe like this one will last you an impressively long time. You can definitely find robes which have the same quality as this one and will cost two or three times as much, so even though it’s more expensive, it’s still a fairly solid bargain according to shoppers!</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Luxe hotel quality</li><li>Great size options</li><li>Glowing reviews</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Expensive</li><li>Fewer color options</li><li>Heavier material</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31qxEDspZ3L._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Starting at:<span class=shopping-price__price>$33</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>This type of bathrobe is certainly the most common kind you’ll come across on your search for best bathrobes for women. Terry is the same material traditionally used for towels, so this is the best robe you’ll find for your bath or shower needs. This particular version is made from 100% cotton, which is ideal for sensitive skin and particularly breathable. When you’re soaking wet after you finish bathing, you can slip into this robe and dry yourself up instantly!<p>Terry robes may not be the softest or coziest of the bunch, but if you’re looking for something that will help you dry off faster, this is the right robe to get. You can have different robes for varying purposes, and it’s clear this one has a specific role it will play in your day-to-day life. Plus, there are handy pockets!</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Cotton material</li><li>Hypoallergenic</li><li>Comes with pockets</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Slightly short</li><li>May run big</li><li>Not super soft</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31RAcf3vcYL._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Starting at:<span class=shopping-price__price>$26</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>Many robes you may come across on your search reach down to the knees or somewhere in the calf region, but this one practically extends all the way down to the floor! If you want to fully surround yourself with coziness from head to toe, this is the robe you should check out now. The length is amazing, and the quality of the material is pretty fantastic as well.<p>Reviewers describe it as ‘very soft’ and claim it has a bit of stretch to it too. Any time fabric has a bit of give, it usually means that it’s that much more comfortable than other options, which is the case with this robe. If you want something that will make you feel relaxed and at ease, look no further than this pick from the best bathrobes for women!</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Very soft material</li><li>Affordable</li><li>Wonderful color and print options</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Too long for petites</li><li>Differing materials</li><li>Not the most breathable</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41Bfbp5ktAL._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Starting at:<span class=shopping-price__price>$7</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>A bathrobe that’s made from satin like this one is perfect for relaxing and getting ready in. These robes make you feel incredibly luxurious and sophisticated, though they’re not the most practical if you’re looking for a robe to wear after you take a shower or bath. The fabric is much thinner and not particularly water-friendly, but you can’t deny that this robe looks absolutely adorable!<p>This robe is also a solid option to pick up if you’re looking for something to match a lingerie set you already own. It comes in so many different colors, and the shorter length is clearly romantic. Whenever you want to make yourself feel special or sensual, slip into this bathrobe to boost your confidence instantly. It’s a date night must, and shoppers agree.</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Tons of color options</li><li>Very affordable</li><li>Stretchy material</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Lower quality</li><li>May be too short for some</li><li>Hand wash only</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31Hr092HB1L._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$22</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>If you’re looking for a bathrobe to suit your post-shower needs that’s softer than a terrycloth robe, a waffle knit option like this one is a great alternative. The material may not be as absorbent as a terry situation, but it’s certainly more powerful than a satin or silk robe. You can find these types of robes at high-end spas often, so if you want to create a relaxing and elegant experience at home, this robe is a must-have!<p>This specific waffle knit robe is made from a cotton-blend material and feels incredibly lightweight, which is ideal for the hot summer months. Both the sleeves and the hem are shorter too, so you won’t feel overheated while wearing this robe. Plus, the price is simply outstanding!</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Quality material</li><li>Comes with pockets</li><li>Fun color options</li><li></li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>May be too short for some</li><li>Not the absolute softest material</li><li>Thinner fabric</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31fyN3ZZc5L._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$30</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>This extra plush robe is made for feeling cozy around the clock! The material has a sherpa-like quality, which is what some of the best blankets are made from, so wearing this robe will essentially feel like wrapping every inch of your body up in a snuggly blanket. You may not want to wear this robe after you take a bath or shower, but it does a great job at keeping you warm when it’s chilly.<p>Shoppers describe this bathrobe as ‘warm and comfortable,’ and they love how it feels when they wear it. The material may be a little too thick for the spring and summer months, but when it’s cold outside, you can guarantee that this fleece robe will make you feel as warm as can be.</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Super soft material</li><li>Heavier feel</li><li>Tons of colors to choose from</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Made from polyester</li><li>Trickier sizing</li><li>Not ideal for post-shower wear</li></ul><a class="article__thumbnail affiliate-item__thumbnail" href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com//wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41vuilNy3BL._SL500_.jpg></a><p>Price:<span class=shopping-price__price>$128</span></p><ul class=affiliate-item__tab-titles><li class="affiliate-item__tab-title active" data-item=tab-1>Description</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-2>Pros</li><li class=affiliate-item__tab-title data-item=tab-3>Cons</li></ul>If you’re shopping for the best bathrobes for women, there’s a chance you may be a fan of spas. In that case, this robe from Coyuchi is a solid option to consider. It resembles a bathrobe you would find at a top spa, and the material is said to be incredibly absorbent. This makes it great for self-care evenings when you’re indulging in a bath or steam shower. The lightweight robe made from organic cotton has racked up rave reviews from shoppers, who praise its quality, relaxed nature and soft feel.<p>While it can be washed in your standard washer-dryer, some do report it may shrink —&nbsp;so keep that in mind during maintenance. As it’s made from organic cotton, it will function fabulously for the summer months. The handy tie closure is the cherry on top of this excellent robe for women!</p><ul class=affiliate-item__advantages><li>Ultra-absorbent</li><li>100% cotton</li><li>Quick-drying material</li></ul><ul class=affiliate-item__disadvantages><li>Expensive</li><li>Some shoppers report shrinkage in dryer</li><li>May be slightly sheer</li></ul><h2>Finding the Best Bathrobes for Women: A Buyer’s Guide</h2><p>If you’re buying bathrobes for women, you may think that the task is easy — but when you truly look at how many different options there are, you may not know how to make the right choice.
