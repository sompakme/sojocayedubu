And why is it that when you feel like putting your feet up by the fire with cakes just like mother used to make, you end up spending the evening at the local charity meeting? It is something to do&nbsp;with your fondness for folks and the warm popularity that this brings you. You cannot help getting involved in some way because you were born with a very developed social conscience. You possess a healthy self-respect and feel that others deserve the same, no matter where they come from.</p><p>Although you may have eccentric ideas, you are blessed with the common touch; you can listen with great perception and respond with understanding and&nbsp;sensitivity. Your heart yearns for shared intimacy but your head pursues objective truth and collective concerns. Although you have a logical, scientific mind, you are actually drawn to things because of your great feeling for them. It is this personal feeling for larger causes and for the family of man that you are able to communicate to people, and therefore you are capable of truly motivating the masses.</p><p>Having an Aquarius Sun Cancer Moon, when at peace with yourself, you possess a most pleasantly paradoxical personality, for you are a friendly, modern, future-oriented visionary whose inspiration derives from the cradle of the past. Wherever you have belonged – in terms of family, community, or nation – you will carry it with you as a central inner drama into your future.</p><p>Traditional values inform all you do, even if you are not consciously aware of them, and irrespective of whether you kick against them or embrace them utterly. It is easy for you to get attached to beliefs and to remain unaware of the influence of your security needs. But one of your potentially great strengths is holding and honoring the best values from the past without becoming a slave to them, for your Aquarian spirit is two steps ahead of everyone else, and must feel free to add its unique contribution.</p><p>With an Aquarius Sun Cancer Moon, you come into your own where the personal and impersonal meet, where your personal feelings, lofty ideals and social conscience can work fruitfully together, as in teaching, politics, social work, art, literature or drama. You will aim to justify your love of something by studying and analyzing it, and finding out how it is valid for others. In this way, you often end up universalizing your personal experiences and turn them into a cause, into a mission. Your best creativity hinges on the acknowledgment that you are not only the past but also the future, not only collective but also personal, not only an observer but also a passionate participant in the panorama of life and human history.</p><h3>Keywords For An Aquarius Sun Cancer Moon:</h3><p>Humanitarian; vivid imagination; idealistic; compassionate and helpful; social conscience; companionable; popular; lofty emotions; progressive thinker but emotionally old-fashioned; a sensitive individualist; democratic spirit; the kind-hearted rebel; the friend of the people; the poet and the social worker.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cancer Rising</h2><p>If you have Cancer Rising, you are very sensitive to emotional signals from other people. You have extraordinary insight into human motivation. There is a reserve about you that is sometimes difficult to penetrate, but underneath is a warm, affectionate, loving, and giving nature.</p><p>With Cancer Rising, you are adaptable to different kinds of people even though you are not liable to make instant friendships. It takes a while for you to let someone get really close.</p><p>Cancer Rising individuals tend to moodiness, and others may not always find you in a receptive frame of mind. Sometimes you can be crabby and impatient and exhibit a snappish temper. You are touchy, and others have to be careful of what they say lest they hurt your feelings. Your sensitivities are so heightened that you sometimes take offense where none was intended.</p><p>However, with Cancer Rising, this same sensitivity is what sets you apart from the crowd. You possess great imagination and awareness. Many Cancer Rising individuals are extraordinarily gifted as writers, poets, and painters. Because you are so tuned in to the nuances of other people’s motivations, you are able to absorb what others are feeling and thinking. You pick up opinions, thoughts, facts from all around you and, being very clever and practical (as well as visionary), you are able to put all this information to work for you.</p><p>Cancer Rising individuals are also clever with money, prudent and cautious, and have a native shrewdness in business. You know how to make wise investments and where to get the best value. Though you usually have to climb the ladder through your own efforts (rather than the efforts of others), you are likely to accumulate material success as the years go by.</p><p>You won’t hog the spotlight, but on the other hand you want public recognition for your talents. With Cancer Rising, acclaim and applause can be hard to come by, so you tend to have a way of feeling sorry for yourself. You complain that the world does not appreciate you, but your complaint is usually an effort to win reassurance that quite the opposite is true.</p><p>As a Cancer Rising you have obstacles in your path, especially when young. However, as you surmount each difficulty and succeed (Cancer Rising has great tenacity of purpose), you become stronger and more self-assured.</p><p>If you have Cancer Rising, you are likely to have a round expressive face, pale luminous eyes, slender arms and legs, and a rolling gait to your walk. Your body may be thickset through the middle, and you are prone toward putting on weight as you get older.</p><p>The Moon, which rules Cancer, is very prominent in your birth chart. The influence of the Moon bestows kindness, imagination, sympathy, deep emotion, an ability to cherish and protect, a retentive memory. It also encourages laziness, inconstancy, restlessness, passivity, and untidiness.</p><p>Uncover deeper insights into your personality, motivations, & desires with an <a href=#><span><strong>In-Depth Astrology & Numerology Natal Chart Analysis</strong></span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tb7UpbCdoaaeu6Z6wqikaKulo3quu86nZpqppZa%2FqsHSZqqupl2strW0jJyYp5uVp3quu86nZJqmlGKworrCnqlmqpmotq%2Bz</p></div><div id=links><a href=./artie-lange-dating-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Artie Lange: dating, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</a>
