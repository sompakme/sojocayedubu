The OC ladies went wild on the Aug. 3 episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County! The women slammed down shots, swam with sharks, took off their tops, drove golf carts into restaurants, and more as their Tahitian trip ravaged on. Which Housewives were whooping it up the hardest and which Housewives were in tears? Read on to find out!</p><p><strong>Tamra Judge</strong></p><p>As soon as the ladies reached their huts on the water, Judge was ready to celebrate by going skinny-dipping. “Why not be naked?” she asked of her other Housewives.“Why not live free?” And freedom prevailed as Judge let her new boobs loose for a dip in the clear Tahitian ocean.</p><p>The other Housewives were less excited to take part in Judge's skinny-dipping shenanigans. Only Edmonds joined Judge in the water, and she was fully clothed. Judge implored her to embrace the French spirit and take her top off in the French Polynesian islands, but Edmonds just responded sadly, “But I'm American!”</p><p>Eventually the revelry had to end, and as Judge got out of the water, Dubrow was waiting with a towel and a loving scowl. “I promised Eddie I would keep an eye on you!” she muttered with a laugh as she wrapped Judge up in a towel. Well, it seems like all the other islanders got an eyeful of Judge as well, Heather!</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> The ladies were welcomed to their new digs in Moorea with a dance. During the performance, Judge characteristically immediately zeroed in on the fact that the male dancers weren't wearing underwear. “Are his balls hanging out?” Judge kept whispering to everyone. The questioning became so constant that Gunvalson jokingly commented that the underwear-less dancers were a personal gift she planned for Judge.</p><p><strong>Meghan King Edmonds</strong></p><p>The Housewives spent their morning talking about a topic near and dear to their hearts — motherhood. When Edmonds tried to join in with her own stories of being a stepmom, she was immediately shut down by the other ladies. “It's not the same when the children aren't your own,” Gunvalson commented when Edmonds tried to express her love for her stepchildren.</p><p>Edmonds tried to advocate for herself by saying that they couldn't understand what it's like to be a stepmother, but that didn't sway either Gunvalson or Judge from their positions. Gunvalson even commented that she thought that Edmonds was being “disrespectful” by trying to take on a mothering role with her stepchildren.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually all the hate got to Edmonds, and she started to cry over her lack of biological children. It seems as if Gunvalson's hazing is really starting to get to the newbie!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best Moment: </strong>When Gunvalson, Judge and Beador decided to stay home and not go out to dinner, Edmonds had some harsh words to dole out on the reasoning behind their decision. “Old people get tired!” The rookie strikes back!</p><p><strong>Shannon Beador</strong></p><p>It's a new day for Shannon Beador after she got over the cold that kept her sidelined her first night in Tahiti. “I just had amino acids and am charged with energy!” Beador announced to the group, waving her hands in victory as she prepared for Fun Shannon to take over.</p><p>It was easier said than done though, as the day's activities involved getting into water with sharks and stingrays. Beador partnered up for the adventure with Gunvalson, and screamed and shivered her way with the ideal, literally becoming entwined with both Gunvalson and the instructor out of fear. Thankfully, she survived and even managed to pet one of the stingrays, who felt like gooey leather in her estimation. “Swimming with stingrays and sharks! Check that one off my list!”, Beador declared before adding “Never again!”</p><p>That was not the only challenge Beador faced, as her home life brought its own share of troubles when her husband, David, called. Turns out that her daughter got into an incident during her first sleepover that involved her fracturing her foot during a toilet papering gone wrong. Beador seemed shaken by the fact that her daughter's illegal antics meant that she wouldn't be able to play in an important basketball tournament, but the Housewife did her best to keep her negative thoughts at bay. “David and I will handle this vandalism incident as a team!,” she calmly announced before allowing herself return to her self-proclaimed Fun Shannon status for the vacation.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> When Beador was asked about whether or not she would go ever go skinny-dipping, her answer was a comic display of honesty. “Vacation Shannon will never be topless because she breastfed for three years of her life! You'll probably be looking at deflated balloons!”</p><p><strong>Heather Dubrow</strong></p><p>Call Countess Luann, because Heather Dubrow is coming under fire for breaking the Girl Code! While Dubrow was having a boring dinner with Lizzie Rosvek and Edmonds, her decision-making was coming under attack from the likes of Gunvalson, Judge, and Beador. During their wild trip to the bar, the topic of Dubrow's friendship with Edmonds came up, and Beador was troubled to learn that Dubrow was close friends with Jim Edmonds' previous wife, Alison.</p><p>“It's against Girl Code to be friends with the third wife when you're friends with the second wife!” Beador complained. “It's just not cool!” While the incident didn't cause much trouble this week, it seems as if this will be a point of contention for the two in the future.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> Dubrow took a moment to blow one of the tour guide's conchshell and it was a double entendre-filled affair. First she commented that she “didn't think Terry will be upset about me blowing another guy's conch.”Afterward, she described her experience thusly: “Blowing a conch. Harder than you think. Salty. But fun!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Vicki Gunvalson</strong></p><p>Gunvalson was concerned with one thing and one thing only this week: whooping it up!” When Dubrow, Edmonds and Rosvek went out to dinner, Gunvalson right away worked on galvanizing Beador and Judge into a night of debauchery. So the threesome went out to the hotel bar, where things got kooky right away as Gunvalson tried to drive their golf cart into the restaurant.</p><p>From there, the ladies only got drunker as Gunvalson wanted to guarantee that they were having more fun than the other ladies. “We need to whoop it up because they are whooping it up and I want to make sure we are whooping it up more than they are whooping it up!” Gunvalson drunkenly explained as she ordered a round of shots, which she thought would help them “have fun immediately!”</p><p>Beador, Judge and Gunvalson proceeded to get hilariously wasted as the night went on. They shared drunken love confessions, they danced to their ringtones, and they tried and failed to high five each other repeatedly. By the time the other ladies got back from their dinner and joined them at the bar, the drunken threesome were falling into the pool with all their clothes on as they laughed and spoke gibberish to each other. Dubrow looked on in horror, but Gunvalson was happy as a clam as she peed herself in the pool, secure in her knowledge that she won in the unofficial “Whooping It Up” contest.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> Just before the group dove into the shark-infested waters, Beador asked Gunvalson to take care of her family in case she died. “I swear to God, I will!” Vicki swore sincerely before asking, “Do you have life insurance?” Not even a vacation can tamper Gunvalson's hustle as an insurance salesman! Bless.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Would you be able to "whoop it up" with Gunvalson?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp5Niv6avwKlknaqlo7imuoyvoJyjmWK0trrVmqOsp55isKK%2F06aYrZ2jYsSpu86pZKKsXaq9brXNZquaoJmptm5%2Bj2psbXBf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./thomas-middleditch-ordered-to-pay-ex-wife-2-6-million-in-divorce.html>&#171;&nbsp;Thomas Middleditch Ordered to Pay Ex-Wife $2.6 Million in Divorce</a>
