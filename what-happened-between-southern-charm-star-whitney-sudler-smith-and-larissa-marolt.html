He's the kind of cool, creative, and mysterious person who everyone wants to be friends with. Fans love a lot about Whitney, from his dynamic with co-star Shep Rose to his close relationship with his fabulous mother Patricia. It also helps that Whitney is super fashionable. He's the perfect Southern gentleman in some ways, but he also manages to have rock star style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many cool <a href=#>facts about Southern Charm</a>, including the fact that Whitney originally pitched the concept of the show. But before <a href=#>season 8 of Southern Charm</a> premieres, fans want to know more about Whitney and his love life. What happened between Whitney Sudler-Smith and Larissa Marolt? Let's take a look at this relationship.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-whitney-and-larissa>What Happened Between Whitney And Larissa?</h2><p>While Whitney came up with the idea for Southern Charm, he doesn't share as much as his co-stars. Shep's dating life has definitely been on display since season 1 of the reality series. Shep has been known as someone who loves casual dating and doesn't think that marriage and settling down are in his future. In season 7, however, Shep began seeing Taylor and realized that he could become more serious about someone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whitney, on the other hand, is filmed hanging out with Patricia or his friends Shep and Craig Conover, and he's always a friendly, smiling presence at dinner parties. But when it comes to Whitney's own love life, he's been much more private than his co-stars who allow the show to film their dates and breakups.</p><p>Whitney did allow fans to see one of his relationships, as when he was dating Larissa Marolt, she appeared on the show.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia explained to Bravotv.com</a> that she was a fan of this romance: according to Distractify.com, "His girlfriend Larissa Marolt is a superstar in Europe. She was Austria's next top model, was on the European version of dancing with the stars, and has won the equivalent of an Oscar for her work in television. She is a lovely person and is as beautiful on the inside as well as on the outside."</p><p>The couple first met in New York City in 2013, according to Distractify.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Us Weekly reported that Whitney and Larissa seem to have broken up in 2019. People think this is the case because there aren't photos of the couple after January 2019. Larissa is a famous model and she won Austria's Next Top Model when she was still in high school, according to Bustle.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which ‘Southern Charm’ Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-whitney-and-madison-lecroy>What Happened Between Whitney And Madison LeCroy?</h2><p>No one seems to know exactly when Whitney and Larissa broke up, or why they did. Maybe it was the pressures of being in a long-distance relationship, as Whitney seems to split his time between Charleston and Los Angeles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors about Whitney Sudler-Smith and Madison LeCroy</a>. According to Us Weekly, DeuxMoi, a social media account, said that Whitney and Madison were kissing in Charleston at a restaurant. Both Patricia and another source said that this definitely wasn't the case. Patricia mentioned it being an "April Fool's" joke.</p><p>It makes sense that Whitney would be linked to some of his co-stars over the years since people are always curious who is dating who. While Madison had a relationship with her co-star Austen Kroll, Madison is now engaged to Brett who she had been seeing for 7 months, according to Page Six.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Shep Rose Before 'Southern Charm'?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-whitney-and-kathryn-dennis>What Happened Between Whitney And Kathryn Dennis?</h2><p>There have also been rumors about Whitney Sudler-Smith and Kathryn Dennis. According to Cheat Sheet, Patricia said that Craig made up the rumor that Whitney liked Kathryn in a romantic way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Patricia said, “He has never had a thing for her …that was a story concocted by Craig ….he’s been with Larissa for 5 years now." Fans love Patricia and they appreciate her even more knowing that she is willing to be so honest about her son's love life.</p><p>There have been some moments on Southern Charm when Kathryn and Whitney seemed particularly close. According to People, Cameran Eubanks said that the two were romantically involved, and Kathryn said it was true. Kathryn explained, “The first time Whitney and I hooked up he said ‘Don’t tell anyone,’ and I was really intimidated by him at the time so I was like, ‘Okay, I really, really won’t.' But at the end of the day, he’s the one that ended up telling everyone. I even lied to Thomas and at that point I was idiotically in love with him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is ‘Southern Charm’ Star Madison LeCroy’s Job?</a></span></p><p>While Whitney Sudler-Smith and Larissa Marolt are no longer together, and perhaps that relationship just naturally ran its course, fans are curious to see if Whitney will be dating anyone new in season 8 of Southern Charm.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Cast of Bravo's 'Southern Charm' Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGko7K6edKum6WdomLArrXToWSwoJGpeqmtz6mcp52UYsGwecuaqaKro5Z6rq3RqKOtZaOptq24jJ2YraGenHpzfJFqZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./yellowstone-s-luke-grimes-5-things-to-know.html>&#171;&nbsp;Yellowstones Luke Grimes: 5 Things to Know</a>
