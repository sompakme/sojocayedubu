A female lead is something that will flip the entire script and create an entirely new generation of Bond films. Maybe now fans will get to see men vying for the attention of a female intelligent agent. As for past James Bond films, let's take a look at the beautiful women who complemented the leading men of the series for nearly six decades! Their roles haves turned them to the successful actresses they are today.</p><h2 id=eva-green-8-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Eva Green: $8 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eva Green appeared in Daniel Craig's first-ever James Bond film, Casino Royale in 2006. This role was widely praised and has earned the actress a spot on this grand list. Interestingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green actually turned down the role at first before later accepting it</a>. Casino Royale was the highest-grossing Bond film until another Craig installment, Skyfall, was released in 2012.</p><h2 id=gemma-arterton-8-5-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Gemma Arterton: $8.5 Million</span></h2><p>Gemma played the role of Strawberry Fields in the film Quantum of Solace alongside Daniel Craig. In 2008, there were two love interests for Bond including Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes. Two is better than one right? Bond charmed his way into both these ladies' hearts, but Gemma Arterton left her mark on the fans. Gemma has accumulated this net worth from her roles in Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. Unfortunately, her time as Bond girl ended in getting smothered in crude oil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denise-richards-12-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Denise Richards: $12 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>Denise Richards is a very well-known American actress</a> and has appeared in many television shows as well as films. Richards' most recognized movie roles are Carmen Ibanez in 1997s Starship Troopers, Kelly Van Ryan in 1998s Wild Things, and of course, Christmas Jones in 1999s The World Is Not Enough. Denise Richards stepped into the shoes of the British secret agent’s lover but didn't receive all praise. Some fans believe her character was over-sexualized but she is still cashing in as one of the richest Bond girls.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ana De Armas' Most Famous Roles Before The New James Bond Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jill-st-john-20-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jill St. John: $20 Million</span></h2><p>Jill St. John played Tiffany Case in 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever. This was only the seventh installment for the James Bond saga and Jill's most widely recognized appearance. Interestingly enough, Jill's love transpired off-screen since she dated not one, but two Bond actors – Sean Connery and George Lazenby. Neither romance lasted since she is currently married to actor Robert Wagner.</p><h2 id=ursula-anderson-25-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ursula Anderson: $25 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Honey Diver is the face you think of when you think of classic James Bond girls.
