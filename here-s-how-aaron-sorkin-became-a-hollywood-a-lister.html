The play became a huge hit, getting great reviews and a Tony Award nomination.</p><h2 id=en-route-hollywood-stardom>En Route Hollywood Stardom</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sorkin's meteoric ascension to A-list status as a writer and <a href=#>producer in Hollywood can be mainly ascribed to his unconventional approach to the art of storytelling</a> as well as his remarkable writing abilities.

For example, in The West Wing, he told stories uniquely by having conversations run into each other and moving the camera quickly. This method made the show seem more like a real conversation, which helped the show become popular. The West Wing contributed to Sorkin's establishment as a Hollywood A-List writer and producer. He continued to produce and create successful television programs such as Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and The Newsroom.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:</span><a href=#>The Highest-Grossing Aaron Sorkin Movies, Ranked</a></p><h2 id=sorkin-s-many-awards-and-recognitions>Sorkin’s Many Awards And Recognitions</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his work on television, Sorkin continued to write screenplays for various successful movies.
