child, their life should change massively. After all, as parents, you can only teach your children to be the best people they can be and hope that they make the right choices with their lives. When it comes to celebrities who have kids, they have something else to worry about when it comes to their children since the paparazzi put their young ones under an unfair microscope. As a result of that attention, the world has been treated to some amazing moments in which <a href=#>celebrity’s children stole the show from them</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>19 Celebs Who Had Babies When They Were Old Enough To Be Grandparents</a></span>In some cases, <a href=#>celebrities have had kids who have gone on to eclipse them</a> in terms of fame. Sadly, there have also been too many examples of times when <a href=#>a child has seemingly been crushed by their parent’s fame</a>. Unfortunately for Norman Reedus, his eldest child Mingus got wrapped up in a huge controversy in the past. Since then, most of Norman’s fans lost track of the situation which has left them wondering what happened to Mingus since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-mingus-reedus-became-so-controversial>How Mingus Reedus Became So Controversial</h2><p>On September 21st of 2021, New York City police were called to the scene of Manhattan's San Gennaro street festival after an incident that involved Mingus Reedus. After talking to people on the scene, the police arrested Mingus and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was eventually charged with misdemeanor assault</a> after a woman that Mingus didn’t previously know claimed he punched her in the face. According to what that woman told police, she had a verbal confrontation with Mingus at the street festival before he turned violent and struck her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Celebrities Who Have Had Brushes With The Law</a></span></p><p>After news of that Mingus Reedus was charged with a crime hit the headlines, Norman Reedus’ son instantly became a controversial figure. In response to the media’s coverage of the situation, Mingus spoke to the New York Daily News <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to tell his version of events</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to what Mingus Reedus told the New York Daily News, he was at the street festival with friends when things went downhill when they came across five women. “We didn’t think anything of it, but these five girls followed us for two blocks, throwing food at us and yelling. We told them to leave us alone, but they kept following, threatening to hurt my girlfriend and her friend. It was very apparent that these girls were under the influence and looking for a fight.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Photos Of Norman Reedus Through The Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Mingus Reedus went on to say, things turned violent when the five women went after him. “These girls swarmed me, one pulling my hair from the back, another throwing water in my face.” According to Mingus, when the five women came after him, he threw out his arm to try to defend himself and accidentally struck one of them in the process. “Ten seconds later the police got involved. Police saw one of the girls hurt and refused to listen to the context. My intention for that day was to mind my own business and play fair games.”</p><p>When they were asked to comment on the incident, the police stated that the woman who pressed charges against Mingus Reedus was taken to a hospital and treated for a minor injury. Once Mingus was charged with misdemeanor assault, he was given a desk appearance ticket to answer to the incident in court at a later date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-mingus-reedus-after-he-was-charged-with-assault>What Happened To Mingus Reedus After He Was Charged With Assault?</h2><p>After the world learned about charges being laid against Mingus Reedus, his lawyer Isabelle Kirschner stated that the accusations against him were “baseless”. However, in the modern criminal system, a lot of people who maintain their innocence go on to plead guilty to lesser charges to avoid going to trial for several potential reasons. With that in mind, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that Mingus ultimately went down that route.</p><p>Ultimately, Mingus Reedus took a deal that involved him pleading guilty to the lesser charge of disorderly conduct. When it came time for Mingus’ sentencing, he was only ordered to attend five counseling sessions. As a result of Mingus taking a deal, he never stood trial so there is no way for anyone other than the parties involved to know what really happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there is no doubt that Mingus Reedus has become controversial after the incident and all of the fallout, it also is clear that his career hasn’t hit the skids. After all, in June of 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mingus walked the catwalk at a Versace runway show</a> thirty years after his mother did the same thing. For those that are unaware, on top of being Norman Reddus’ son, Mingus’ mother is the supermodel Helena Christensen.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Norman Reedus' Son, Mingus Lucien Reedus?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXay2tbSMp6arpZGjerOxxJ2srGWTpLu1vs6vnKurmZa5br%2FOp2SmoZ6cwrR7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-ronni-krongold-from-love-island-australia-meet-the-fitness-trainer-on-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Ronni Krongold From Love Island Australia?
