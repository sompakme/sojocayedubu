Kirk reacted, “I’d overlooked that your folks originated from Thailand to serve George Washington.” The remark prompted the Human Rights Campaign to withdraw their support of Kirk and changing it to Duckworth, expressing his remarks were “profoundly hostile and supremacist.”</p><p>On November 8, she vanquished Kirk 54 percent to 40 percent to win the Senate seat.&nbsp;Duckworth and&nbsp;Kamala Harris, who was additionally chosen in 2016, are the second and third female Asian American congresspersons, after&nbsp;Mazie Hirono who was chosen in 2012.

She vanquished previous Deputy Treasurer of Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthifor the Democratic designation on March 20, 2012, at that point confronted officeholder Republican Joe Walsh in the general election.&nbsp; In the 2014 general political decision, Duckworth confronted Republican Larry Kaifesh, a United States Marine Corps official who had as of late left deployment-ready as a colonel.

Five years later she became assistant federal secretary of veterans affairs under then-President Barack Obama. She went on to serve two terms in the House and was elected to the Senate in 2016.</p><p>This spring Duckworth, 50, became the first woman to give birth while serving in the Senate. Illinois is a state that produces presidents, from Lincoln to Obama; Tammy Duckworth has visibly sacrificed for her country. That could make her an interesting foil to Trump, who talks continually about military spending and caring for vets while not having served in uniform himself, but it hardly means she’ll see a path to victory in 2020. (And be prepared for more “birther” smears: Duckworth was born in Thailand to a U.S.-citizen father and Thai mom.
