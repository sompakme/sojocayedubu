That said, his career definitely seems to be on the rise due to his Top Gun: Maverick role and his undeniable charisma and speaking skills.</p><p>Given that Sweeney and Powell could quickly be in the same place in their careers and people are fascinated by both of them, there are lots of people who'd love to see them date. As a result, there was some excitement when there were headlines about Powell and Sweeney. That begs an obvious question, why is the press reporting on the two young actors together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell>What Happened Between Sydney Sweeney And Glen Powell?</h2><p>Back when the show Euphoria premiered on HBO, there were two main aspects of the show that people were talking about. First off, there was a lot of excitement that the always popular actor Zendaya was going to star in a new show. After that, people were fascinated by how extreme the events depicted in Euphoria can be.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zendaya Says 'It Just Felt Like The Right Thing' To Become A Producer On Euphoria</a></span></p><p>Not too long after Euphoria first became a sensation, however, a lot of people began to focus on another aspect of the show. Once viewers got to see more of Sydney Sweeney's Euphoria performance, she quickly became the show's breakout star.</p><p>Thanks to the notoriety Sweeney has gotten from Euphoria, she has gone on to land several notable roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sydney-sweeney-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the television side of things, Sweeney landed a starring role in the first season of the immensely popular show The White Lotus. On top of that Sweeny has been cast in several movies. Most notably, Sweeney has been hired to play Julia Carpenter, a character who goes by Spider-Woman in the comics, in the upcoming Marvel movie Madame Web.</p><p>Long before Glen Powell starred in Top Gun: Maverick, he has been working consistently since the early-2000s. Some of Powell's past movie credits include roles in movies like The Dark Knight Rises, The Expendables 3, Ride Along 2, and Hidden Figures among others.</p><p>Powell has also notably become one of the actors the acclaimed director Richard Linklater loves to work with. After all, Powell has starred in Linklater's movies Fast Food Nation, Everybody Wants Some!!, and Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood. Linklater has also hired Powell to star in his upcoming film Hitman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/glen-powell-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>When looking at all the aforementioned projects that Sweeney and Powell have been a part of, it is clear the two actors haven't appeared onscreen together. However, as it turns out, that is going to end soon.</p><p>In March 2023, Sweeney and Powell were caught on camera looking pretty cozy together. Photographed seemingly vacationing on a boat together, a lot of people saw those images and assumed that Powell and Sweeney had become a couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sweeney and Powell clearly would make a gorgeous couple based on the photos of the duo wearing swimwear together, people's assumptions about them turned out to be wrong. In reality, Powell and Sweeney weren't vacationing together. Instead, the two actors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">were filming an upcoming rom-com they will headline together</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sydney-sweeney-at-the-2019-la-premiere-of-euphoria.jpg><p>If anyone is disappointed that Sweeney and Powell aren't a couple, they may be focusing on the wrong part of this story. After all, rom-com fans should be excited they will get to see Powell and Sweeney portraying characters that fall in love on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-sydney-sweeney-dating>Who Is Sydney Sweeney Dating?</h2><p>In the years since Sydney Sweeney rose to fame, her personal life has wound up in the spotlight a couple of times.

After all, many of Sweeney's fans are unaware that the actor has been off the market for quite a few years now.</p><p>In 2022, People published an article that revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney is engaged to a man named Jonathan Davino</a>. Unlike Sweeney, Davino isn't in the public eye so their relationship has flown under the radar but the couple has reportedly been together for several years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sydney-sweeney-and-sydney-sweeney-and-jonathan-davino-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>According to a Cosmopolitan article about Davino, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is a businessman who is 13 years older</a> than his famous fiancée.
