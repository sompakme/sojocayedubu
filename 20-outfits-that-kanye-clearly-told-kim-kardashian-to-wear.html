Kim K puts that business brain to work. She does the interviews. Generally, she doesn't make outlandish statements. Kanye West is a different story. In 2018, Kanye West claimed that he is "currently the single highest paid person in footwear. That means I make more money on shoes than Michael Jordan." His 2018 Yeezy 350s sales claim wasn't too different: "Only thing close to this is the iPhone." GQ had no choice but to systematically break Kanye's claims down to separate the facts from the myths. Unfortunately for Kanye, GQ's conclusions were less flattering.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye has an asset, though. She comes in one eye-popping, brazen, selfie-taking package, and her name is Kim. As Kim steps out in a new Yeezy outfit every day, Kanye gets his walking advertisement. It might make for good publicity, but not every look is getting approval. The more we see of Kim, the more we're seeing Kanye. Now that Kim's wardrobe has shifted to a solid carousel of Yeezy slides, puffer jackets, leggings, and over-the-knee boots, fans are wondering: "How much of Kim's wardrobe is her own choice?" Questioning just that, here are 20 Kim K outfits that were likely at the direct request of Kanye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yeezy-has-become-the-default-look><strong>YEEZY HAS BECOME THE DEFAULT LOOK</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Vogue described Kanye's Yeezy roll-outs as "guerrilla paparazzi-style." The magazine was referring to the pretty aggressive marketing that Kanye uses to ensure that the entire world sees his Yeezy designs. If Kim Kardashian is anything, it's great advertising. This look might be the best walking advertisement for Yeezy, but let's face it – is it a good look? For an ultra fashion-conscious style queen who probably has Donatella Versace on speed dial, we're leaning towards "no." You're looking at the Yeezy Season 8 debut. But are you also looking at the "beginning of the end" of Kim?</p><h2 id=all-the-times-kim-couldn-t-choose-her-own-shoes><strong>ALL THE TIMES KIM COULDN'T CHOOSE HER OWN SHOES</strong></h2><p>This one has got to be painful for Kim. The reality star has an undeniable love of fashion and a seemingly unlimited budget. The hot pink Chanel jumpsuit that Kim recently wore isn't even available to purchase yet. It's been a good 4 or 5 years now that Kim's Christian Louboutin, Gucci, or Louis Vuitton shoes have slowly been finding themselves replaced with Yeezy footwear. Presumably, when it's Lucite Heels or sock boots, Kim can still feel herself. Here is Kim in a pair of $150 Yeezy nylon slides. You're looking at an A-list celeb in West Hollywood. In, um, C-list footwear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oh-look-the-same-slides-for-a-fancy-wedding><strong>OH LOOK, THE SAME SLIDES FOR A FANCY WEDDING</strong></h2><p>The press ripped Kanye apart for this one. In August 2018, Kim and Kanye made a high-profile appearance to witness the Miami wedding of their close friends, 2 Chainz and Kesha Ward. In honor of the Gianni Versace mansion in Miami, Kim wore a sizzling green vintage Versace dress. The Daily Mail was quick to notice Kanye's footwear choice – Yeezy slides that appeared to be too small for his feet. Fans branded them "pool shoes" amid an outpour of what the newspaper called "ridicule."</p><p><strong>Kanye's decision to pair his Louis Vuitton suit with tiny Yeezy slides led to comments of "ridicule" and "disrespect."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-kim-and-kylie-were-yeezy-klones><strong>WHEN KIM AND KYLIE WERE YEEZY KLONES</strong></h2><p>Don't be fooled into thinking that this Kim and Kylie look was one their "more affordable" Shop The Look occasions. Being a Yeezy spokesperson doesn't give you a day off. On some days, the duty even extends to other members of your family. In June 2018, Kim and Kylie Jenner were&nbsp;photographed&nbsp;in Calabasas dressed head-to-toe in Yeezy Season 7. The Yeezy Supply website currently lists plain t-shirts for $140. Leggings and sweatpants cost $300. That tiny cross-body bag? $125 for a piece of nylon. The sisters completed the look with Yeezy sock boots, which retail for between $500 and $1200.</p><h2 id=the-days-when-kim-s-stylist-feels-unemployed><strong>THE DAYS WHEN KIM'S STYLIST FEELS UNEMPLOYED</strong></h2><p>Let's just put this into perspective. In the last year, Kim's outfits have included the following: #1, A vintage 1992 Dolce & Gabbana blazer dress. #2 a Louis Vuitton shirt dress that isn't yet available to buy. #3 A $2,888 trench coat from the Maison Margiela designer that Ariana Grande loves. #4 Christian Dior x Rihanna shades worth $330. Alongside Kim's trusted Gucci, Versace, and Prada favorites, this 2018 Yeezy look gave us– precisely none of it. Way too loud, way too impractical, but 100% doing Kanye a favor, this look might have a new-gen edge, but it isn't getting praise from fashion magazines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yeezy-dictated-kim-s-entire-japan-wardrobe><strong>YEEZY DICTATED KIM'S ENTIRE JAPAN WARDROBE</strong></h2><p>Where the Kardashians go, so too go the cameras. In 2018, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney Kardashian made a very high-profile trip to Japan. Kim channeled Tokyo's Harajuku edge by dying her hair pink. That was pretty much the extent of it, though. Alongside the maternity clothes dressing Khloe Kardashian, Kim's wardrobe was a steady feed of Yeezy drops, and they were decidedly not "glam." This metallic spandex look with dad socks and Yeezy 700 Wave Runners went viral, but it wasn't getting the nod of approval from Vogue's editors. "Raising eyebrows" were the words used by the global fashion magazine. (The hair did get&nbsp;compared to a&nbsp;fairytale, though.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-really-it-did><strong>NO, REALLY, IT DID</strong></h2><p>"Japan Tries Its Hardest To Keep Up With The Kardashians." That was the headline from country's own newspaper, JapanTimes. 50% of this look is Kim's confident walk. This businesswoman is used to holding her head high – when you put yourself up for self-promoted controversy, you'd better be prepared. The other 50%? It's the Yeezy wardrobe that has become a bit of a second skin for Kim. As comments pour in over Kim's looks, the opinions are pretty clear. Some fans love it. Many, however, just don't dig the puffer jacket and leggings finish.</p><p><strong>"Yeezy is the 2nd fastest growing company in history." Kanye's tweets are definitely confident.</strong></p><h2 id=another-day-another-parking-lot><strong>ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER PARKING LOT</strong></h2><p>It's hard to judge how a celebrity is truly feeling. Back in the day, celebrities used to make their emotions clear – just like the rest of us. Smile if you're happy, don't smile if you're sad. Maybe it's the Victoria Beckham effect here, but something about walking around looking a little bit miserable has turned emotion on its head. Apparently, if you're rich and happy, you shouldn't smile. Kim Kardashian actually seems pretty happy. This mom adores her three children and she's hugely passionate about her business. Walking around parking lots for Yeezy look books might be fun for one day. When it's a near-daily affair, though? You okay, Kim?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-300-shorts-that-nobody-wants><strong>THE $300 SHORTS THAT NOBODY WANTS</strong></h2><p>With Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Gucci confirming it, it's official. Stuffy formal wear is out, and athletic looks are in. There's athleisure wear and athleisure wear, though. The Louis Vuitton High Arch Sneaker that Gigi Hadid was spotted trying on in NYC? Awesome stuff. The Gucci sneakers that Selena Gomez adores? They're kind of cute. Presumably, for a special occasion, Kim was given the day off from Yeezy to attend 2 Chainz's wedding. She wore vintage Versace. On work duty? Kim gets this. Yeezy heels, a Yeezy top, and not much that screams "quality." These Yeezy shorts retail for $300. Weirdly, the only people we've seen wearing them are Kardashians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yeezy-x-disneyland><strong>YEEZY X DISNEYLAND</strong></h2><p>Nobody expects you to turn up to Disneyland in a Swarovski-encrusted gown. That said, when you're a celebrity in 2018, you can wear a surprising amount of glam... pretty much anywhere. When Kendall Jenner takes her court side seat at a basketball game, she'll wear a "Dior Addict" t-shirt. Beyonce shows up to the game in custom-made furs. In 2018, Kim took her kids to Disneyland. The magazines were focusing on Kim's Yeezy metallic shorts and sneakers, though. In fact, Kim wore the exact same jacket that Kanye had worn some months earlier.</p><p><strong>"Kim Kardashian Basically Dressed Like A Crossing Guard To Take Her Kids To Disneyland,"&nbsp;wrote Harper's Bazaar.</strong></p><h2 id=all-the-times-yeezy-accessorized-kim-s-couches><strong>ALL THE TIMES YEEZY ACCESSORIZED KIM'S COUCHES</strong></h2><p>In 100 years time, will historians document job descriptions of 2018 as "we're not quite sure what this generation was doing, but posing on couches with phones was definitely a thing?" That's because it is. Hard as it is to believe, posing on couches is part of Kim's job. Those social media pictures don't create themselves. Also, take your shoes off the couch, woman! Oh, wait. They're new. In 2018, Kim posed for (yet another) Yeezy look book post. She wore $500 stretch canvas Yeezy boots, $400 leggings, the $1500 Yeezy Shearling Lined Canvas Jacket, and the staggeringly expensive $300 Yeezy sock bra.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-the-times-the-mood-said-it-all><strong>ALL THE TIMES THE MOOD SAID IT ALL</strong></h2><p>A picture says a thousand words, right? Sometimes, you just can't hide a facial expression. In February 2018, Kim was spotted in Los Angeles with a rather stony-faced expression. It's hard to say what was on Kim's mind. Given that Kim cares so much about her appearance though, it's not outside the realm of possibility that her wardrobe was the cause for the #moodface. The leather trench coat is definitely in fitting with Kim's style. Maybe Kim wasn't all too pleased about pairing fine leathers with Yeezy sports shorts and Yeezy PVC heels? Sorry, we forgot to mention the Yeezy hoodie.</p><h2 id=literally-what-is-this><strong>LITERALLY WHAT IS THIS?</strong></h2><p>The fashion world is used to unexpected trends. If you've noticed the number of celebs wearing those cat-eye shades right now, you'll know how quickly a look can become trendy. Skintight spandex is a look that the fashion world took one glance at in the 1980's and put in the "home gym" category. In 2018, Kim wore what is quite possibly the most bizarre Yeezy outfit to date. Shimmering and skin-tight is a look that Kim is used to. Her clingy Versace dresses definitely show her love of all things figure-hugging. What this outfit is supposed to do? We're stumped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Does this look even have a name? Rock-climbing x Parking Lot?</strong></p><h2 id=or-this><strong>OR THIS?</strong></h2><p>Bear in mind that you're looking at a fashion icon who regularly hangs out with Louis Vuitton's menswear director, Virgil Abloh. Kim moves in very sophisticated circles. Donatella Versace seems to regularly pop round for fittings. "Lagerfeld customize my gold chair" might be Nicki Minaj's lyrics, but the Chanel director creates custom pieces for Kim. In 2018, yet another Calabasas parking lot was graced with this Yeezy look. The over-the-knee boots, we'll take. They're a solid look with a solid Ariana Grande fanbase. At $980, these boots are probably the best long-term value item that you can find on The Yeezy Supply. The weird metallic spandex? We'll pass.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-one-activity-that-gets-impractical-clothing><strong>THE ONE ACTIVITY THAT GETS IMPRACTICAL CLOTHING</strong></h2><p>Remember the point of activity-geared clothing? Running apparel is designed to be comfortable, sweat-absorbent, and streamlined. Equestrian wear provides that all-important padding for horseback riding. There isn't much in the way of casual ice-skating wear, but most of us just use our heads. We're going to be on slippery ice. The over-the-top furs aren't something we wear on the rink. In 2016, Kim took North West ice skating in NYC. The Yeezy gear was less prominent in 2016, but this leopard-print Givenchy fur coat has Kanye written all over it. Kanye adores furs and he wears them frequently – in the street.</p><h2 id=the-yeezy-mudrat-that-social-media-ridiculed><strong>THE YEEZY MUDRAT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA RIDICULED</strong></h2><p>Not one of Kim's best-received looks. In 2017, Kim was once again a spokesperson for Yeezy's latest drop. While Business Insider has reported that Yeezy sneakers have been the most sought-after shoe of 2018, the media outlet was likely referring to Yeezy 350s. This is the Yeezy Mud Rat 500. Big whoop, it has a new colorway. Twitter fans came out with a ton of "grandpa" comments, according to Highsnobriety. The "ugly sneaker" trend is now so trendy that Vogue is endorsing it. Complete with Yeezy outerwear and a hobo hat? Less trendy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Twitter went after Kanye West's new sneaker – fans slammed this look with grandpa comments.</p><h2 id=the-20-something-look-that-just-isn-t-working><strong>THE 20-SOMETHING LOOK THAT JUST ISN'T WORKING</strong></h2><p>Fashion definitely gives you freedom. One of the best things about fashion in recent years is just how well it's broken down barriers. Women can wear whatever they want, and no-one cares if you're 45 and wearing a mini skirt. There are some limits, though. The over-the-knee slouchy boot look is one that we're seeing on a 21-year-old Kylie Jenner and a 25-year-old Ariana Grande. The Kanye influence was definitely visible on Kim's Pablo shirt here, but that isn't what caught our attention. Kim is with her bestie, Larsa Pippen here. Larsa is 44 years old, while Kim is 37. They're dressed like teens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fortunately-a-20-something-is-available><strong>FORTUNATELY, A 20-SOMETHING IS AVAILABLE</strong></h2><p>Thank goodness for that power family. Part of the reason that the Kardashian-Jenner clan are so immensely successful is their solid ability to act as a pack. Khloe endorses Kylie Cosmetics. Kylie wears Khloe's Good American jeans. The Good American clothing line even plays Kanye's tracks for its promotions. Getting the pattern? Kanye is a businessman. If there's a golden opportunity, he'll take it. Getting Kim and Kylie to wear Yeezy clothing targets two huge age ranges in one quick go. Kim takes care of the 30 and 40-something moms. 21-year-old Kylie rakes in the teens.&nbsp;This reminds us – would Yeezy exist without these women?</p><h2 id=the-lace-up-yeezys-that-kim-is-always-seen-in><strong>THE LACE-UP YEEZYS THAT KIM IS ALWAYS SEEN IN</strong></h2><p>Yeezy may be a clothing brand, but it is, above all else, a footwear brand. The Yeezy Boost 350 was one of the most-requested sneakers of 2018, with celeb fans galore. Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lopez, Big Sean, Gigi Hadid, and Kevin Hart have all been spotted in them. The Yeezy knit dress has been spotted on... nobody except Khloe Kardashian. Like Khloe, Kim is wearing the lace-up Yeezy boots here. Somehow, we're not sure that high-profile pics will shift this boot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Drake are all Yeezy Boost 350 fans. The Yeezy lace-up boot? No one seems to be buying it.</strong></p><h2 id=penny-for-your-thoughts-kanye><strong>PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, KANYE?</strong></h2><p>When Kanye West has a thought, he takes to Twitter. GQ followed Kanye's Yeezy tweets, including the one you can see below. GQ reports that Jordan Brand alone brought in revenues of $3.1 billion. Retail analysts looked at Kanye's tweet, but they weren't too impressed.</p><p><strong>"I am currently the single highest paid person in footwear. That means I make more money on shoes than Michael Jordan."</strong></p><p>Think of Kanye what you will. Presumably, anyone you know will have their own opinion.
