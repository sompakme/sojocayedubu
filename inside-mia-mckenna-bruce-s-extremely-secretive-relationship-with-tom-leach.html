Her slow climb into fame has resulted in appearances in hit shows such as Netflix's 'The Witcher' and Peacock's 'Vampire Academy'. Her roles on those shows aren't necessarily huge, but they're giving her a platform to launch a bigger career on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She currently has over 200 thousand followers on Instagram. She's clearly getting a lot of attention and clout from her acting. Like a lot of newfound celebrities, she's also gotten a lot of curiosity into her personal life. Considering that she's just become famous, a lot isn't known about her love life. Who is she seeing?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Married Couples Who Met on Set</a></span></p><p>There were rumors a few years ago that Mia was seeing a co-star named Ceallach Spellman, but Mia clarified that the rumors had zero truth to them on social media. Mia's recently gotten engaged to someone else but has kept it on the low. Her fiancé is Tom Leach, an actor she worked with on 2019's 'The Rebels'. Here's everything to know about their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-mia-mckenna-bruce-39-s-relationship-with-tom-leach>Everything To Know About Mia McKenna-Bruce's Relationship With Tom Leach</h2><p>2019 was clearly an important year for Mia. Before falling in love with Tom, she made her break as Marilka on 'The Witcher'. Yes, that means Mia got to work with Henry Cavill. It's assumed that Mia felt about Henry the same way their fellow co-star <a href=#>Freya Allan felt about him</a>, which is positive. Just like with Freya, Mia may have learned a thing or two about acting that only an experienced star like Henry could teach.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After Departing The Witcher And Losing Superman, Henry Cavill Already Has A Major Project Lined Up</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Now that Liam Hemsworth has joined the show</a>, maybe Mia could learn from him too. If Mia ever comes back to play Marilka, that is. Her character hasn't appeared on the show in a long time, but she could always come back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mia-bruce-as-marilka-on-the-witcher.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year 'The Witcher' came out, Mia starred in an indie war movie called 'The Rebels'. She acted alongside Tom, who was also the main star of the film. It's heavily presumed they met each other via the movie, but nothing is confirmed. The actual movie takes place in the first century when Rome was at its peak in terms of world power. Mia and Tom play rebels who end up falling in love.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>LOOK: Snow In Rome Drone Footage</a></span></p><p>Until very recently, Mia's relationship with Tom was relatively private. She still hasn't talked about it much. What is known is that there are posts on social media of the two being very comfortable with each other. First, a picture on Twitter of Mia kissing Tom on the cheek proved they were dating. Their engagement was then confirmed on Instagram when Mia posted a photo of her and Tom kissing, with an engagement ring hooked on her left ring finger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-mia-mckenna-bruce-and-tom-leach-going-to-get-married>Are Mia McKenna-Bruce And Tom Leach Going To Get Married?</h2><p>The post of their engagement was put up on February 24th, 2022. What has happened since then?</p><p>Mia posted on her Instagram a review of her journey in 2022. The picture of her showed her and Tom holding hands happily on a beach. In the description, Mia said 2022 was her "favorite year" and that the main reason was her engagement with Tom. They might not be married yet, but it should be coming soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mia-bruce-on-a-boat.jpg><p>It might be hard for them to find an exact date for a wedding, especially considering the two of them are actors. While Mia's busier than Tom, they still have to find the perfect time for the wedding and honeymoon. It's entirely possible that it could be years before they get married, as they'll have to plan their future projects around the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weddings can be crazy, so it's not bad to be meticulous about the details. Especially if Mia keeps growing in fame as she has been. They'll have to make sure everything is perfect, from the food to the guests, to even the security. Seeing as they're both famous, there could be some extra wedding crashers. Who knows even celebrities can crash weddings too. Usually, it's in a comedic way, but sometimes it's not. Britney Spear's ex <a href=#>was sentenced to jail for crashing a wedding</a> once.</p><p>Before all of that, the two will have to make sure their love is perfect for marriage. In the US, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">somewhere around 40-50%</a> of marriages end up in divorce, so it's not something that should be taken lightly. However, if Mia's social media pictures mean anything, their future together appears to be pretty bright.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-is-39-vampire-academy-39-season-2-happening>When Is 'Vampire Academy' Season 2 Happening?</h2><p>Mia's most recent performance of note has been as the main character Mia Karp on the show Vampire Academy. Its first season premiered in 2022 and many fans have wondered what the future holds for the show. Mia's character was in a relationship with another girl named Meredith on the show, and many fans have come attached to their romance.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mia has talked about</a> her character's romance with Meredith. She explained how important it was that the character's romance grew "organically". If and when the show continues, it's expected that their love continues to take center stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Review Geek</a>, 'Vampire Academy' has not yet been renewed for another season. That doesn't mean it won't be renewed anytime soon, especially regarding the fact the first season just ended. Only time will tell if the show goes on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopldorCssc2nmGaaoqqwpr%2BMm6aynqKesq%2BwjK2mpmWcmq6ktIyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rhoa-s-kenya-moore-and-marc-daly-settle-divorce-5-years-after-split.html>&#171;&nbsp;RHOA's Kenya Moore and Marc Daly Settle Divorce 5 Years After Split</a>
