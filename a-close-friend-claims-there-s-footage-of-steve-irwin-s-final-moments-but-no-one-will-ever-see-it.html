That's because the TV star and wildlife expert wanted the camera to continue rolling, even if he was injured. Sadly, this time, there would be no recovery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Bindi Irwin Pays Tribute To Late Dad, Steve, Announcing Name Of Her New Baby Girl">Bindi Irwin Pays Tribute To Late Dad, Steve, Announcing Name Of Her New Baby Girl</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyons did reveal that his best friend's final words were "I'm dying,"</a> but he doesn't reveal much else about the incident, apart from how it happened.

No doubt the footage would be disturbing not just to those close to Steve, but to anyone; the scene involved underwater shots of Steve's injury, including blood everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lyons elaborated that the venom caused Steve "agony," and that it was suspected that in addition to heart damage, Steve's lung may have been punctured.

In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror UK claims that "millions of people" continue to search for the footage</a> online.

She maintains that it was completely fabricated, and seemed disgusted at the exploitation of "people's sadness."</p><h2 id=was-steve-irwin-39-s-family-present-when-he-passed-away>Was Steve Irwin's Family Present When He Passed Away?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steve Irwin's kids weren't on site when he was injured and subsequently passed away, and Terri Irwin is glad for it. She's been quoted as saying that normally, her two kids would have been on the boat. However, she expressed relief that Robert and Bindi didn't see their father suffer and pass away; it would have been "horrendous."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Has Steve Irwin's Wife Been Encouraged To Remarry After The Death Of Her Husband?">Has Steve Irwin's Wife Been Encouraged To Remarry After The Death Of Her Husband?</a></span></p><p>The children, who were two and eight at the time, followed precisely in their father's footsteps, growing up and working at their father's zoo, where he was also buried. <a href=#>Robert and Bindi have always drawn fascination from fans</a> who watched them on TV or saw them at the Australia Zoo, but growing up in the spotlight doesn't seem to have affected them much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The siblings continue to work with their mom at the zoo, doing what their famous dad did: teaching people to love (and not fear) animals.
