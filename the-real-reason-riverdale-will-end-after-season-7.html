We want to make sure it goes out the right way.” He also added, “I think they, too, felt that seven years is the right amount.

Truly, I think it was bittersweet,” he said. “I think we were all anticipating it, we thought that seven would be it.”</p><p>He also admitted that he didn’t expect a show like Riverdale to go on for as long as it had.</p><p>“When the call came, it definitely was bittersweet and there was a sadness. But, I don't think anyone ever imagined a show based on the Archie comic book characters, that was dark and twisted, would last nearly as long as it did, and resonate with an audience,” Aguirre-Sacasa explained. “So I feel good.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-the-cast-feel-about-riverdale-s-end>How Does The Cast Feel About Riverdale's End?</h2><p>As for the stars, there are also <a href=#>mixed feelings as they work on a whole season of Riverdale one last time</a>. “I do dread the day that we actually wrap because I know it’ll be an incredibly emotional experience,” Lili Reinhart, who stars on the show as Betty Cooper, said during a recent appearance on On Air with Ryan Seacrest. “I'll miss my family out there and I kind of like having my apartment in Vancouver. … It will be the wrapping of a big chapter in my life.”</p><p>That said, the actress has also said that she’s ready to move on and in fact, it looks like she’s started to, with the Netflix film Look Both Ways.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Lilli Reinhart Has Done Since Her Split From 'Riverdale' Co-Star Cole Sprouse</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Cole Sprouse, who had onscreen and offscreen romance with Reinhart on the show, had also revealed that he and his castmates feel it’s time to “wrap it up with a bow.” The actor, who also recently starred opposite Lana Condor in Moonshot, has made it clear that he now wants to pursue other projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I'm not a creative force behind [Riverdale].
