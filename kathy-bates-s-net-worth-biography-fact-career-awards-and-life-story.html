Bates would star in another Stephen King film, “Dolores Claiborne,” in 1995. In 1991, she played Evelyn Couch in “Fried Green Tomatoes” and earned a Golden Globe nomination, and she was nominated for her first Primetime Emmy in 1996, for her portrayal of Helen Kushnick (Jay Leno’s manager) in the HBO film “The Late Shift.” In 1997, Kathy played Molly Brown in “Titanic,” one of the most commercially successful films of all time with a worldwide gross of $2.195 billion.

Bates also became a spokesperson for lymphedema, and in 2018, she took part in Capitol Hill Lobby Day in an attempt to get more research funding for the condition and spoke at the DC/VA Walk to Fight Lymphedema & Lymphatic Diseases. She was honored with a 2018 WebMD Health Heroes “Game Changer” Award for her dedication to raising awareness of lymphedema.</p><p><strong>Awards and Nominations:</strong> Bates won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for “Misery” in 1991, and she was also nominated for “Primary Colors,” “About Schmidt,” and “Richard Jewell.” She has been nominated for eight Golden Globes, winning Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for “Misery” in 1991 and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for “The Late Shift” in 1997.
