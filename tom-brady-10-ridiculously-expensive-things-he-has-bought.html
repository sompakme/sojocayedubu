His career is far from an average one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Tom Brady Does To Achieve Success</a></span></p><p>This year, he became the first player in history to win six Super Bowls! He is also the recipient of four Super Bowl MVP awards. We all know what these accolades translate to – money! Lots, and lots of money.

Let’s take a look at 10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Tom Brady Has Bought….</p><h2 id=aston-martin-db11>Aston Martin DB11</h2><p>Tom Brady picked up a stunning <a href=#>Aston Martin DB11</a>. This ridiculously expensive car exudes power and prestige and is right in line with his character! A regular, run –of –the-mill Aston Martin DB11 will cost the average buyer $360,000 to purchase. Of course, Tom Brady wasn’t interested in that one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>CNN reports show that he spent an additional $50,000 to be the proud owner of the Special Edition version of this vehicle. Then, some more cash was dumped on personal touches to customize the vehicle. With 630 horsepower, we’re sure he’ll have lots of fun, and will get to his destination quickly!</p><h2 id=expensive-trips>Expensive Trips</h2><p>There are many travel destinations that are popular go-to places to unwind and have a good time. We’re all familiar with the hot-spots that most couples and families tend to gravitate towards. Tom Brady has a totally different state of mind when he goes on vacation. He travels to places that most of us can only dream of visiting. In 2018, he traveled to Qatar with his wife Giselle Bundchen.</p><p>They stayed in the Ritz Carlton, and Architectural Digest reports that they spent their time visiting all the hotspots as well as the local markets. To truly experience an authentic trip, they, of course, paid for an exotic camel ride and enjoyed an afternoon indulging in luxurious experiences such as this one.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Things Tom Brady Does To Achieve Success</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=new-york-condo>New York Condo</h2><p>Tom owns various properties across the world. This enables him to travel freely and still be able to “go home”. When we think of <a href=#>condo units</a>, we don’t often attach them to a $17 million price tag, but Tom Brady sure did! This hot property is located in Manhattan’s Flatiron District and House & Home reports that it spans over a 3,310 square foot space.</p><p>Their unit was designed by the world-famous architect Peter Marino. It features 3 massive bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, an elevator, and massive brass doors that lead to an absolutely stunning view. This unit has massive windows with perfect views of the Hudson River and the Empire State Building. Being on the 48th floor with floor-to-ceiling windows sure has its perks!</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-ghost>Rolls Royce Ghost</h2><p>Many have dreamt of owning this car -Tom Brady customized his order on one! That sounds about right! This beast features a monstrous V12 engine that can be heard from a distance, and seen if you don’t blink! It’s definitely a fast car to boast about.

Tom Brady has a massive car collection that he’s proud of, but we’re certain this one tops the list as one of his most prized possessions.</p><h2 id=private-chef>Private Chef</h2><p>Tom Brady’s entire career is dependent upon his health, so staying in tip-top form is of the utmost importance. He took some expensive steps to ensure that healthy cuisine and a personally structured menu is easily accessible at all times. Allen Campbell was hired to ensure that Tom’s cuisine is carefully crafted to suit his needs, his health requirements, and is available at all times.</p><p>Allen has to carefully curate a raw vegan diet for Tom, and work around the long list of items that Tom refuses to consume. Meals are designed differently for game-time, and Allen has to remain adaptable to Gisele’s needs, as well as those of their children. This is sure to cost a pretty penny!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 15 Strange Facts You Didn't Know About Tom Brady</a></span></p><h2 id=l-a-mansion>L.A.

If that’s not cool enough for you, let’s not forget that this place took 4 years to build and spans over 14,000 square feet.</p><p>It features 8 bedrooms, a six-car garage, and The Pursuitist reports their pool as being lagoon-shaped, and adjacent to their spa and wine cellar! This stunning estate was featured in Architectural Digest as being one of the most desirable properties in LA. To highlight just how desirable this residence really is – Dr.Dre is reported to have offered $50 million to buy it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audi-s-for-everyone>Audi’s For Everyone!</h2><p>Tom Brady proudly represents the Audi brand and he is known to give back to them, generously!&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made headlines for his generous Audi-gift-giving!&nbsp; Very, very generous, in fact! He has been widely recognized for his 2007 generous gifting of Audi Q7’s for his teammates. Yes, that’s right. He gave him each of his linesmen a brand new Audi Q7, valued at $42,500 each!</p><p>It’s great to appreciate teammates, but this took generous gifting to a whole new level! For those who are keeping track of the cash he throws around as gifts to other people, Sports CBS also reported on his shopping spree in 2007, during which time he purchased UGG Boots for the entire Patriots team!</p><h2 id=bugatti-veyron-super-sport>Bugatti Veyron Super Sport</h2><p>This may be a shock to some of you, but you cannot just simply walk in and purchase a <a href=#>Bugatti Veyron</a>.

He can now zip across the highway at super-fast speeds topping 431 kph.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 People Who Have Publicly Trashed Tom Brady</a></span></p><h2 id=flights-on-private-jets>Flights On Private Jets</h2><p>When you’ve reached this level of success and notoriety, regular flights just won’t do! Tom Brady is known to secure private jets for himself and his family each time he travels. This means no lines, no fuss, no general public, and of course, a crew of on-board staff to tend to his every need. Among the things that Tom Brady seems to “need”, are special privileges.</p><p>In July of 2019, Ballzone reports that Tom Brady asked the crew of his private jet if he could fly the plane. That’s right. When you’re Tom, you can pretty much have anything your wallet can pay for. After dropping tonnes of cash on private jets, it’s apparent that he is comfortable to request a few more favors!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audi-r8>Audi R8</h2><p>Tom loves his <a href=#>Audi R8</a>, and we can see why.
