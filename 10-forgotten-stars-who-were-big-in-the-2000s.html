Timberlake as well as Hollywood stars like Reese Witherspoon and Tom Cruise, but today's list is not about those.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="The Disney Channel Stars Of The 2000s, Ranked By Current Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Disney Channel Stars Of The 2000s, Ranked By Current Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Today, we are taking a look at the stars who were certainly having quite promising careers in the 2000s — only to sort of disappear from the spotlight by the time the decade was over. From musicians like Ashlee Simpson and JoJo to actors such as Jesse Metcalfe and Taylor Lautner — keep on scrolling to find out just who made the list!</p><h2 id=jojo><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>JoJo</span></h2><p>When musician JoJo's debut single "Leave (Get Out)" peak the top of the US Billboard Pop Songs chart in 2004, the young musician — who was only 13 at the time — became the youngest solo artist in history to ever achieve that. Back then everyone expected <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JoJo</a> to have a huge career in pop music, however — that never happened. While the musician did release five studio albums since her breakthrough, her first one titled JoJo still remains her most famous one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jesse-metcalfe><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jesse Metcalfe</span></h2><p>Next on the list is actor Jesse Metcalfe who rose to fame as John Rowland on the comedy-drama show Desperate Housewives back in 2004. After that, John starred in popular movies such as John Tucker Must Die and Loaded — but ever since then, his career seems to have slowed down. While Jesse Metcalfe is still active in the acting industry — it's safe to say that the peak of his career remains in the 2000s.</p><h2 id=ashlee-simpson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ashlee Simpson</span></h2><p>Let's move on to musician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashlee Simpson</a> who rose to fame after her debut single "Pieces of Me" was a huge success in 2004. At the time, Ashlee's sister Jessica was already a famous popstar — so it certainly didn't come as a surprise that her younger sister followed in the same footsteps.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Grammy Best New Artists From The 2000s: Where Are They Now?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Grammy Best New Artists From The 2000s: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p>In the 2000s, Ashlee released all three of her albums and she also starred in her very own MTV reality television show The&nbsp;Ashlee Simpson Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chad-michael-murray><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Chad Michael Murray</span></h2><p>Another famous actor who was big in the 2000s is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad Michael Murray</a>. Chad rose to fame as Lucas Scott on the teen drama One Tree Hill in 2003 and after that, he starred in quite a few famous teen movies from the 2000s such as Freaky Friday and A Cinderella Story. However, since then it seems as if the actor's career slowed down and while he did have guest appearances in shows like Agent Carter and Riverdale — his best days are certainly behind him!</p><h2 id=michelle-trachtenberg><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Michelle Trachtenberg</span></h2><p>Next on the list actress Michelle Trachtenberg who rose to fame as Dawn Summers in the supernatural drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the year 2000. Since then, Michelle has starred in teen movies such as Ice Princess and <span style=text-decoration:underline>17 Again</span>. Michelle is also known for portraying Georgina Sparks in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the teen drama Gossip Girl</a> which premiered in 2007, however — since then the actress hasn't had many notable roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-stiles><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Julia Stiles</span></h2><p>Another actress who was pretty big in the 2000s is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Stiles</a> — the star of movies like 10 Things I Hate About You, Save the Last Dance, and Mona Lisa Smile. While Julia did continue acting after the 2000s, it's safe to say that her peak was still in that decade. Most recently the actress could be seen alongside Jennifer Lopez in the 2019 crime drama Hustlers — however, we rarely get to see the actress in a leading role anymore.</p><h2 id=jesse-mccartney><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jesse McCartney</span></h2><p>While musician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse McCartney</a> technically entered the industry as an actor in the 90s — it wasn't until 2003 when his music career kicked off that the star reached international fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs We Forgot Lindsay Lohan Used To Hang Out With In The 2000s" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs We Forgot Lindsay Lohan Used To Hang Out With In The 2000s</a></span></p><p>That year, his debut single "Beautiful Soul" was released and everyone was convinced that a new pop heartthrob was born. Unfortunately, it kind of seems as if Jesse's career never properly kicked off — even though the star did end up releasing five studio albums (most of which are from the 2000s).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-lautner><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Taylor Lautner</span></h2><p>Let's move on to actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Lautner</a> who rose to international fame for his portrayal of Jacob Black in The Twilight Saga movie series which premiered in 2008. Prior to that, Taylor was known for starring in the 2005 superhero adventure movie The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. While Taylor certainly starred in quite a few movies since then — it definitely seems as if his career slow down over the years.</p><h2 id=jonathan-bennett><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jonathan Bennett</span></h2><p>Speaking of actors who were famous in the 2000s — next on the list is Jonathan Bennett. Jonathan became known for his portrayal of Aaron Samuels in the 2004 comedy movie Mean Girls as well as Bud McNulty in the 2005 family comedy Cheaper by the Dozen 2. While Jonathan may have been a known name in the 2000s — it safe to say that today plenty of people have forgotten about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aly-amp-aj><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Aly & AJ</span></h2><p>Wrapping the list up is the musical duo Aly & AJ whose third album Insomniatic — which was released in 2007 — was by far their most successful one. Anyone who was a teenager at the time surely remembers their hit "Potential Breakup Song" which was recently re-released in its explicit version. While the two sisters are definitely very talented — it certainly seems as if their peak was in the 2000s!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Worst 2000s Box Office Bombs That Were Actually Great Movies" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Worst 2000s Box Office Bombs That Were Actually Great Movies</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidqKqXpMG1sc1mqq2Zoqh6uLTOZq6eqpVir6qzjKKlZqyYmnpzfI9pqmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./14-things-everyone-forgot-about-mila-kunis-and-macaulay-culkin-s-relationship.html>&#171;&nbsp;14 Things Everyone Forgot About Mila Kunis And Macaulay Culkin's Relationship</a>
