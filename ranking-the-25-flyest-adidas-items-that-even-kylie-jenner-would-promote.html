athletic&nbsp;functionality,&nbsp;and&nbsp;celebrity influence&nbsp;since it was founded almost seven decades ago back in Germany in 1949.&nbsp; The brand has been using celebrity clout to elevate their premier products from Jesse Owen's working the newly designed one-of-a-kind handmade spiked cleats in the 1936 Olympic Games, to the launch of the Yeezy brand which has inflated the reseller sneaker market, which is estimated to be $6 billion today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adidas has so much power, it acquired mega-star influencer Kylie Jenner as their latest brand ambassador. Jenner got quite some slack last year when she signed a deal with the&nbsp;rival brand, Puma, sparking a massive family feud with brother-in-law and Yeezy mastermind, Kanye West. While Jenner defended her decision to work with the brand on her own terms, we know family certainly comes first when it comes to the Kardashian Jenner Clan.</p><p>This week Kylie announced her partnership with Adidas launching her own color combo and went on Instagram&nbsp;to&nbsp;announce herself as their latest brand ambassador. Check out where Kylie's newest custom kicks end up on this list of the top 25 flyest Adidas items around the world.</p><h2 id=raf-simons-x-adidas-independence-day-replicant-ozweego>Raf Simons x Adidas: Independence Day Replicant Ozweego</h2><p>Raf Simons’ Adidas collab has brought us back to the 90’s with these Unisex Independence Day Ozweegos.

This exclusive pair of kicks will cost you $450 retail, available for purchase at Opening Ceremony.</p><h2 id=alexander-wang-x-adidas-track-suit>&nbsp;Alexander Wang x Adidas Track Suit</h2><p>Many designers have added their own spin to the classic three-stripe Adidas tracksuit, made famous in the late 80’s by hip-hop legends, RUN DMC. This year, Alexander Wang collaborated with the sportswear company, creating a unique red lettered strip panel down the side of the leg. The red text reads like software code within brackets with ironic “factory code” directions “&lt;DO NOT REMOVE>” creating a three-lined stripe of text, evocative of the brand’s signature look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These Spring/Summer’ 18 joggers are currently sold out but cost $150 retail, if you can find them in-store.
