A healthy relationship is still built on foundations of love, trust, chemistry, connection, and communication, even if we do find each other through apps and talk via direct messenger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We gathered advice from some of the most renowned voices when it comes to love and romance to find out what the signs of a truly healthy relationship are. We also discovered what to look out for to know that a relationship isn’t built to last and could be heading for a breakup.</p><p>Check out our findings below! Here are 15 signs of a healthy relationship, and five signs that the end is near, according to the experts.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-their-life-goals-are-the-same><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: Their Life Goals Are The Same</span></h2><p>According to the experts at Psychology Today, a clear sign of a healthy relationship is two people sharing the same life goals: “You both know what you want out of life, what your common goals are… and are firmly committed to achieving these together.”</p><p>There is room for difference in a relationship, but not on the important matters like these.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-respect-each-other-s-family-and-friends><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Respect Each Other’s Family And Friends</span></h2><p>Being good to a person means nothing if you treat their family and friends poorly. Another sign of a healthy relationship is being on good terms with each other’s family and friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This shows that you’re willing to make an effort with the people in your partner’s life for the sake of your partner, even if you wouldn’t otherwise get along with them.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-look-forward-to-seeing-each-other><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Look Forward To Seeing Each Other</span></h2><p>Los Angeles-based relationship expert Dr. Gary Brown told Elite Daily&nbsp;that looking forward to seeing each other is a sign that a relationship is happy and healthy.</p><p>Things like finding yourself “excited to make plans” with your partner and disappointed when you have to cancel show that the relationship is in a good place.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-re-able-to-spend-time-apart><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They’re Able To Spend Time Apart</span></h2><p>A healthy relationship isn’t about spending every moment together. Dating experts agree that a couple should also be able to spend time apart doing things that are important to you as an individual.</p><p>If you’re able to spend time apart without getting jealous or possessive, it suggests that your relationship is going along smoothly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-bounce-back-from-arguing><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Bounce Back From Arguing</span></h2><p>Arguing in a relationship doesn’t mean it’s not healthy. All couples argue, whether they admit it or not. What’s important, according to Mind Body Green, is the ability to bounce back from fights.</p><p>“If you can resolve issues and move forward in your relationship, then you’re on the right track!” explains the wellness site.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-accept-each-other-the-way-they-are><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Accept Each Other The Way They Are</span></h2><p>A big part of any healthy relationship is accepting the other person the way they are. While couples can support each other and help each other to grow, they ultimately need to be able to love each other unconditionally and embrace each other’s imperfections.</p><p>This isn’t always easy, but if you can do it, your relationship is probably in a better state than you thought.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-maintain-their-own-identities><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Maintain Their Own Identities</span></h2><p>Too often, people lose all sense of self when they begin a relationship with someone else. According to Psychology Today, it’s a sign that your relationship is healthy if you can both keep your own identities while still putting time and effort into the relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A relationship might be part of who you are, but it’s not the complete story.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-contribute-equally-to-the-relationship><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Contribute Equally To The Relationship</span></h2><p>A healthy relationship requires both people to contribute equally. One-sided relationships tend to result in a lot of resentment, as well as feelings of entitlement.</p><p>Instead, each partner should be contributing what they can and putting an equal amount of time and effort in so that the relationship works.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-see-each-other-in-their-futures><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They See Each Other In Their Futures</span></h2><p>According to Mind Body Green, your relationship is in a good place if you currently envision each other in your future. It’s even better if you can’t imagine your future without your partner.</p><p>For a long-term relationship, it’s obviously important to see yourself with that person in the long term, even past marriage and kids if that’s what’s in store for you.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-encourage-each-other-to-improve><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Encourage Each Other To Improve</span></h2><p>Relationships are about accepting people for who they are and loving them anyway, but that doesn’t mean a couple can’t encourage each other to improve in various ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Psychology Today&nbsp;explains that when a relationship is healthy, two people “inspire each other” to be better people and encourage each other to grow and change.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-connect-on-a-number-of-levels><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Connect On A Number Of Levels</span></h2><p>There are more levels to a relationship than just physical or just emotional. A healthy relationship takes into account the various elements of a relationship at which two people should be able to connect.</p><p>A sign of a healthy relationship, according to Mind Body Green, is being able to bond with your partner spiritually, physically, emotionally, and intellectually.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-their-communication-game-is-strong><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: Their Communication Game Is Strong</span></h2><p>Any relationship expert will tell you that a couple needs to be able to communicate efficiently to make things last.</p><p>You know that your relationship is in a good place when you can talk to each other about anything and know how to communicate your needs and wants without the fear of being judged or shut down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-re-able-to-disagree-respectfully><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They’re Able To Disagree Respectfully</span></h2><p>A couple will always have arguments, so they need to know how to disagree with each other in a respectful way.</p><p>If they can disagree with each other without hurting each other’s feelings, and accept that sometimes they’re going to feel differently about things, it’s a sign that they’re in a good place.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-there-s-a-sense-of-peace-between-them><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: There’s A Sense Of Peace Between Them</span></h2><p>Mind Body Green explains that there should be a sense of peace between two people in a relationship. Your partner should bring you comfort and happiness, not stress and anxiety.</p><p>If you are overrun by negative emotions when you’re with them, it’s a sign that the relationship isn’t healthy.</p><h2 id=healthy-relationship-they-trust-each-other-no-matter-what><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Healthy Relationship: They Trust Each Other, No Matter What</span></h2><p>Trust is a non-negotiable part of being in a relationship. When your relationship is in a good state, you should trust each other to be there and support one another.</p><p>You can also trust your partner to stay loyal to you, keep your secrets, and follow through with their promises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-end-is-near-they-re-always-annoyed-at-each-other><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The End Is Near: They’re Always Annoyed At Each Other</span></h2><p>On the other hand, a clear sign of a relationship that’s not going so well is when a couple is always annoyed at each other. If you’re always in a negative state when you’re around your partner, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship.</p><p>Although there are frustrations in any relationship, they shouldn’t be constant.</p><h2 id=the-end-is-near-the-arguments-are-getting-worse><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The End Is Near: The Arguments Are Getting Worse</span></h2><p>Fighting isn’t a sign that a relationship is coming to an end, but arguments that are steadily escalating in intensity and duration can mean just that. If all you ever do is fight, it could mean that the end is near.</p><p>All couples go through rough patches, but many splits are foreshadowed by constant fighting that escalated until the end.</p><h2 id=the-end-is-near-they-hardly-communicate-anymore><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The End Is Near: They Hardly Communicate Anymore</span></h2><p>Communication is key, so a couple neglecting to communicate may be headed for a split. They need to be able to express both their negative and positive feelings and communicate their wants and needs so they can be dealt with.</p><p>A lack of communication leads to frustration, misunderstanding, and problems that don’t go away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-end-is-near-they-don-t-want-to-touch-each-other><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The End Is Near: They Don’t Want To Touch Each Other</span></h2><p>The physical side of a relationship is important, even if it isn’t all that matters. While it’s normal to have ups and downs in this area, you’ll know that the end may be near if you’re not interested in touching each other at all anymore.</p><p>It’s a sign that your relationship could be about to end if you no longer desire your partner and they no longer desire you.</p><h2 id=the-end-is-near-they-have-fantasies-of-escaping-each-other><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The End Is Near: They Have Fantasies Of Escaping Each Other</span></h2><p>Psychology Today&nbsp;explains that once you start fantasizing about escaping your relationship, that’s it. While it’s normal to fantasize about other people every now and then, getting consumed by thoughts of wanting out should be a clear signal that it is time to get out.</p><p>This is your subconscious guiding you towards leaving the relationship behind.</p><p>Sources: Psychology Today, Mind Body Green, Elite Daily, Business Insider</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnJufp7GqusZmnLGolafBtHmQbmSsoZejwG60xJqjraCpYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXmUZpynnF2jsqK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bringing-up-bates-news-us-weekly.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bringing Up Bates News - Us Weekly</a>
