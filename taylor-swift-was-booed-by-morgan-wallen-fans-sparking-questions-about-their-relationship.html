However, the disparity between the pair is linked to their fans. In April 2024, <strong>Wallen’s fans caused quite an internet war after he name-dropped the “Cruel Summer” singer. </strong>The Swifties wasted no time swinging into action, leading to questions concerning Wallen’s relationship with Swift.
