As such, when Swift decides to stay in more metropolitan areas, the paparazzi keep track of her every move. But, spending time in the city also allows Swift to see if there are any new properties that catch her eye. It happened in 2015 when Swift was made aware of the fact that a townhouse next to hers was for sale.</p><p>Wanting to make a huge penthouse out of her existing townhome and the one next door, Swift purchased the property.
