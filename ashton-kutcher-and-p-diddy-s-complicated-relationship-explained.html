What many of Combs' fans likely won't know, however, is that the <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> superstar has been friends with <strong><a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a></strong> for years.</p><p>Since <a href=#>Kutcher has headlined many blockbuster movies</a> and Diddy is successful enough <a href=#>to have many employees</a>, the two men have things in common. Still, Kutcher's fans were left with a lot of questions after <a href=#>Diddy's homes were raided</a>. With that in mind, it makes sense that many fans want to learn more about Kutcher and Diddy's friendship.</p><p>This article will reveal what is <strong>known about Ashton Kutcher and Diddy's friendship</strong>. Then, the article will look at <strong>Kutcher's history of having problematic friends</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-stated-he-couldn-39-t-talk-about-parts-of-his-friendship-with-sean-quot-diddy-quot-combs>Ashton Kutcher Stated He Couldn't Talk About Parts Of His Friendship With Sean "Diddy" Combs</h2><p>After Sean "Diddy" Combs had been in the public eye for many years, his career hit a major speed bump in 2024. That year, Diddy was sued multiple times. Following those lawsuits, Diddy was facing allegations about many deeply disturbing and criminal things happening at parties the rapper routinely held.</p><p>In 2019, Ashton Kutcher made an appearance on one of the best YouTube talk shows, Hot Ones. While Kutcher was talking to Hot Ones' host, Sean Evans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the topic of Diddy's parties came up</a>. Instead of sharing stories, Kutcher said that <strong>he couldn't speak publicly about Diddy's parties</strong>.</p><p>"I’ve got a lot I can’t tell. [Kutcher pauses to think for a moment.] I can’t tell that one either."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/your-paragraph-text-2024-03-27t114921-889.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the allegations that Diddy faced in 2024, it is easy to assume the worst about Kutcher refusing to talk about the rapper's parties. However, it is important to note that the allegations against Diddy hadn't surfaced by 2019 when Kutcher appeared on Hot Ones.</p><p>According to Marca.com, several celebrities have spoken out about Sean "Diddy" Combs' notorious parties. Two examples of that are Jamie Foxx and Usher who've both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">implied that wild stuff happened at Diddy's parties</a> .</p><p>With that timeline in mind, it is clear that Kutcher may not have had any idea that his comments would later imply something dark.
