She admitted that she "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't know who the Jonas Brothers were</a>," at the time. It was her older sister who gave Kevin Danielle's phone number.</p><p>It was love at first sight for Kevin who thought, "Gosh, every time I see Danielle, her hair looks so pretty, it’s like someone did it.’ And she was the one who always did it. It just looked like she always took care of herself. She always presented herself in a good way, and that just really attracted me.

"So why would I spend time away from my family while we’re on vacation? I was like, 'why should I waste my time?'”</p><p>Kevin Jonas made a point to prove to her that he wasn't looking for a fling and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted something more long term</a>. Kevin explained, "I was the one that was pursuing her most of the time and I didn't want her out of my sight. She actually ran away twice."</p><p>He admits he even tracked her flight, so he could call her the minute her plane landed back in Jersey. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I cyberstalked her after we met</a> and cyberstalked to see what flight she was going to be on coming home, and then I called her the minute she landed. That might have been a little overboard, but I just went for it," the 'Sucker' singer recalled in a 2012 interview with Glamour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-danielle-jonas-does-for-a-living>What Danielle Jonas Does For A Living</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/danielle-jonas-kevin-jonas.jpg><p>Danielle Deleasa was born and raised in Denville, New Jersey.
