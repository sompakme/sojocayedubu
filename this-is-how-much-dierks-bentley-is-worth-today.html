After a year, he transferred to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, which he graduated from in 1997.</p><p>Following college, Bentley began working at The Nashville Network, which is now known as Paramount Network. His job was to research old footage of country performances. He was banned from the Grand Ole Opry after he trespassed for what he claimed was research purposes.

They first met in 8th grade at Phoenix’s Ingleside Middle School. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I had a crush on her the whole time, but I wasn’t cool enough</a>,” Bentley recalled to People in 2007. “I was way too immature and into drinking beer and guns and blowing things up.” Black agrees, claiming “he was just trouble” at the time. They attempted to date in high school, but things went awry when distance separated them. Bentley moved to Nashville, and Black moved to San Francisco.</p><p>“I used to write her all these crazy love letters that I’d FedExed out to her,” Bentley said of their long-distance relationship. “That’s why I married her! I was worried I’d get blackmailed with those letters!” Black still has every letter her husband wrote her. The two tied the knot in 2005 in a beautiful ceremony in Mexico.
