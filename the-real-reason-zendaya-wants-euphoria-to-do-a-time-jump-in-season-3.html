"It’s funny. I was actually supposed to direct episode 6, but then I had to act in it," she shared. "I didn't have enough time, so unfortunately, I wasn't able to this time around.

"I think it’ll be exciting to explore the characters out of high school. I want to see what Rue looks like in her sobriety journey, how chaotic that might look," she said in August 2022.</p><p>"But also with all the characters, in the sense where they're trying to figure out what to do with their lives when high school is over and what kind of people they want to be.
