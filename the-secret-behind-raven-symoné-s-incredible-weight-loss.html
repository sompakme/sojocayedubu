Raven has lost weight in the past, shedding a significant 70 pounds in 2011, but she didn’t feel comfortable opening up about her weight loss then. Now, having lost 30 pounds in three months in 2021, Raven is sharing her process and beliefs with the world. <a href=#>While her wife Miranda Pearman-Maday has helped her on her weight loss journey</a>, the actress has relied on another method to shed the pounds.</p><h2 id=how-did-raven-symon-eacute-lose-so-much-weight>How Did Raven-Symoné Lose So Much Weight?</h2><p><a href=#>Raven-Symoné has changed a lot since her days on the Disney sitcom That’s So Raven</a>.

The star has since opened up about exactly what she did to lose the pounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with HollywoodLife, Raven revealed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the main secret behind her weight loss success was intermittent fasting.</a> This involves frequent fasting for a set period of time before returning to consuming calories.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'That's So Raven' Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Raven explained that she fasted for a minimum of 14 hours a day, between dinner and the next breakfast, to help get rid of the weight. She “stops eating at a certain period of the day and no snacking, including waiting until the next day to eat, instead of just gorging all day long.”</p><p>Additionally, the actress and former host of The View changed the actual food she was eating too, opting for low-carb choices and sticking to whole foods rather than processed foods.</p><p>In an Instagram post shared with her followers, Raven elaborated on her weight loss diet, admitting that she didn’t “eat any bread” and typically consumed lean proteins and vegetables instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of Raven’s weight loss also came down to her mindset, as she didn’t torture herself by setting an impossible target weight to reach. "I didn't set out with a visual idea of what to look like," she said to HollywoodLife.</p><p>"I don't feel that I'm ever going to say, 'This is how I'm supposed to look,' because when I get to a certain weight, I always find happiness within myself, whatever what size I am."</p><h2 id=did-raven-symon-eacute-gain-her-weight-back>Did Raven-Symoné Gain Her Weight Back?</h2><p>In her interview with HollywoodLife, Raven talked about her previous journey with weight loss, confessing that she has “had a lot of different weight transformations” in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the star has maintained her healthy lifestyle so far, she has previously gained back weight after losing it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Raven-Symoné Has Said About Her Time On 'The View'</a></span></p><p>According to Majic 102.3/9.7, Raven notably lost weight after That’s So Raven ended.

I’m still not subscribing to the standard American diet, which has made a mockery of the human body and created the obese epidemic that is our world today,” she said in her HollywoodLife interview.</p><p>“I continue to understand and learn about insulin resistance and what it means for people like me.
