In 2016, the singer and Tom connected at New York's glitzy Met Gala. On camera, the couple was seen dancing at the event. Taylor and renowned DJ Calvin Harris had just ended their relationship at that point. She was seen holding Tom's hand and kissing him on a beach two weeks after the breakup. The relationship seemed to be going well, and they were spotted together multiple times. At her Fourth of July party, Tom was photographed sporting the now-famous I adore TS T-shirt, and he even introduced her to his mother. Tom made the relationship public so fast that the media accused him of using the singer to gain fame.</p><p>However, the actor defended himself by saying, <strong>"The truth is Taylor and I are together. We’re very happy. Thanks for asking. That’s the truth. Not a publicity stunt."</strong></p><p>The couple’s love affair was very public, to the point that people started wondering if this was for PR purposes only. After only a few months of dating, their split was finally announced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When they broke up that September, Taylor's team said Tom demanded too much attention from the relationship. But according to others close to Tom, he simply became weary of the celebrity. Many felt that Taylor and Tom were <a href=#>really never meant to be</a>. And like most of the singer’s exes, it appears Tom got a mention in one of her songs.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:07</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar53281845.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Taylor Swift Spends Her Billion Dollar Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's net worth has reached billionaire status, and her spending habits are worth noting.</span><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-write-a-breakup-song-about-tom-hiddleston>Did Taylor Swift Write A Breakup Song About Tom Hiddleston?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg><p>Although Taylor never identifies the ex-lover a song is dedicated to, people enjoy doing their research and putting things together using context clues.</p><p>Swifties have long believed that the track <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Getaway Car" from her album, Reputation, in 2017 is about Tom Hiddleston</a>. In the song, Taylor talks about a relationship that she shouldn’t have gotten into so hastily, which sleuths think means Tom, and how she was “running away” from an ex, which is her referring to her former partner Calvin Harris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song reads, "Think about the place you first met me" and how "The ties were black, the lies were white", which is in reference to where Tom and Taylor meet at the Met Gala.</p><p>She also sings "It’s no surprise I turned you in/’Cause us traitors never win." This seems again to point to her being a traitor because she left Calvin for Tom and it didn’t work out.</p><p>One of the Swifties tweeted, "Getaway Car is such a jam and so brutally honest (poor Tom lmao) can’t stop listening."</p><p>Another wrote, "Listening to getaway car hm I’m broken because Tom Hiddleston didn’t deserve it… poor Tom."</p><p>A third fan gushed, "Is Taylor ready to talk about Tom Hiddleston in the Getaway Car TV music video?
