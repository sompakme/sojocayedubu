Her allegations sparked a police investigation, though it was ultimately concluded there was no evidence to charge him with a crime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Armie Hammer's Net Worth Has Changed Drastically Since His Extremely Public Scandal</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Armie later gave an interview to Air Mail</a>, denying Effie’s claims. He said she had a sexual assault fantasy that she asked him to participate him, and the false allegations were an act of vengeance.</p><p>“She planned all of the details out, all the way down to what Starbucks I would see her at, how I would follow her home, how her front door would be open and unlocked, and I would come in, and we would engage in what is called a ‘consensual non-consent scene,’ CNC,” the actor said.</p><p>Effie isn’t the only woman to make allegations against him, either. Armie was also subject to claims of cannibalism fantasies by his ex-girlfriend, Courtney Vucekovich.</p><p>“He said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she claimed, saying she overlooked Armie’s “odd behavior”</a> at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=armie-has-reportedly-been-working-in-an-all-inclusive-resort>Armie Has Reportedly Been Working In An All-Inclusive Resort</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/armie-hammer-at-the-13th-annual-go-gala-2019.jpg><p>The allegations against Armie have halted his career in Hollywood; he was dropped from many projects (and by his talent agency) after Effie came forward with her claims.</p><p>Last year, it was reported Armie was selling timeshares at an all-inclusive resort in the Cayman islands, where he has a friend that works there. He’s reportedly spent much of his time in the Caymans since the pandemic, especially at the height of his sexual abuse scandal.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Photographs published by TMZ</a> showed him in a hotel unfirm, apparently speaking to guests about the benefits of buying a package.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Armie’s manager wasn’t able to provide much context to the photos. “Armie's rep told us he had a friend who worked at the resort, but didn't know whether or not Armie was showing or selling timeshares,” TMZ reported.</p><p>Based on the recent photos, it appears that Armie is back in Los Angeles, where his ex-wife still resides with their two children, and not in the Cayman Islands, at least for now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6WZmnqprcymnKtlnKS8rL%2BMrqWrnZOktK%2B12ZqZpZ1dnrtuusSwZKmgn6m8tHnAZqSopqSdeqKy056pZquVqcGttc2gZKGho2KxqsLOq5qeZZanvK55xKWgs5mSmsGpecKhmKaalafAcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./candy-montgomery-wikipedia-everything-to-know.html>&#171;&nbsp;Candy Montgomery Wikipedia: Everything To Know</a>
