In truth, he is a curious case but an entertaining one at that.</p><p>His life has been a rollercoaster behind the scenes as well. <a href=#>The former 'Apprentice' star</a> has gone through a lot of hardships, including various medical bills which include a nasty motorcycle accident back in the late '80s along with a situation of overdosing.

One of his first major breakout films took place in 1974, 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot'.</p><p>He carried that momentum during the '80s and into the '90s as well, however, he slowly started to lose his way behind the scenes, enjoying the party life a little too much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Pamela Anderson Went From Earning $6.6 Million A Year To Being Flat Out Broke</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Problems started to emerge in the early '90s when overdosed</a>, the actor recalls it being an eye-opening experience, "I OD’d on 3 May 1990, and thank God, because I realized I’d been dancing with the devil in a very small circle and the devil was leading the dance,” he says in his deep Texas drawl. “I left the dance and said: ‘You kick on from here – I’m gone. I’m dancing on my own.’ When you do a drug like cocaine, you want to get that first hit back, but you never will. That’s gone.

Alongside Ability Magazine, he recalls the traumatizing experience.</p><p>"In December 1988. I was on a Harley Davidson at the Washington and Robertson intersection. I came around the corner too fast and slid on some sand. I braked hard, and the bike flipped me over, I hit my head and then my back. I had a double compound fracture in my pelvis, and my skull was split from my ear to the top of my head. It knocked a big hole in my skull, which filled with bone from my jaw."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Here’s How 'Jersey Shore' Saved Mike Sorrentino From Going Broke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After the brain surgery at Cedars-Sinai, I passed on for a time—as in died.

However, he is still successfully booking low-tier gigs to this day, he also released a book. All of this has resulted in a savings of $500,000, a much greater positive in comparison to what he had in the bank just a few years prior.</p><p>At the moment the actor has a few future credits to his name including 'A Millenial Depression Comedy' and 'The Gettysburg Address'. Gary also has a future project in the works which is in pre-production entitled, 'Rabere'.</p><p>Good for the actor who is still able to find work, it seems like a lot of the work lately stems around voice-over work.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Here's How Michael Jackson Went Broke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp2ViZX5zecaaqbJlkqrApsWMoZidZZ6atKLAyK%2BcZm1gZX1xedOoZKGho2K7ornEZp%2BeqpWoeqm71makrpuYYrWmeceaqmasn5muunnBq6aknV2jsrV51qipraBdZ31zfYybmKejoqq9tXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-timothee-chalamet-gay-sexuality-explored.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Timothee Chalamet Gay?
