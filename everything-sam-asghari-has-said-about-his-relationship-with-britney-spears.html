We play tennis together. We play ping-pong together. She’s really good at ping-pong. It’s a real competition. And I’m competitive, but I try to take it easy. Not because she’s a woman. Not because she’s weak, because she’s not. But I grew up with three sisters, so I learned that taking competition too seriously can lead to hurt feelings. Family take it easy on each other. There's a lot of yoga that she likes to do. She's flexible, she has endurance, she does handstands on my legs. I'm not good at it, but I do it because she wants to do it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-openly-admitted-what-he-thinks-about-britney-39-s-conservatorship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sam Openly Admitted What He Thinks About Britney's Conservatorship</span></h2><p>Recently, the popstar publicly opened up about the struggles she has been going through with the conservatorship arrangement imposed in 2008.
