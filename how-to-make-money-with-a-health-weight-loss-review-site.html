This is one of my favorite methods, simply because it’s low cost for anyone to get started with, and it can also bring in long term results if you can get your content to rank in the search results. With all of this in mind, today we are going to take a look at how you can start making money with a health/weight loss review site of your own.</p><p>If there was ever an industry <a href=#>where the money never stops flowing</a>, it’s going to be the beauty, weight loss, and health industry. It’s simply an area where people are always going to spend money, and also want to improve their lives in the process. At the same time, it seems like there is a never-ending supply of products to promote in this field as well.</p><p>Let’s get started in a simple 3-step process!</p><p style=text-align:center><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bigstock-Woman-Showing-Her-Abs-With-Dol-86910122.jpg alt width=900 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>1&nbsp;– Decide on Your Audience and Niche Focus</strong></h3><p>The first thing you need to do is launch a website or blog to post and promote all of your content. However, before even doing this you are going to need to know what demographic audience you are going after and if you want to niche down your focus. The more ‘niche’ your site and content is, the better you will be able to eventually rank, create content and target your audience.</p><p>A perfect example of this would be ‘weight loss’. This topic in itself is way too generic, however, it could easily be broken down into ‘exercise equipment’, ‘weight loss exercises’, ‘weight loss pills’ and everything in between. At the same time, if you were to focus on ‘weight loss pills’, that could be broken down into a wide range of tight niche focuses as well — such as ‘green coffee’, ‘chocolate weight loss’, ‘goji’, ‘garcinia’ and much more.</p><p>Using a tool like Google Trends, we can quickly see what some of the top trending weight loss pills are in the world today. There are also plenty of other tools that can help with niche targeting and keyword research, such as SEMRush and Google Keyword Planner.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/google-trends-weight-loss-1024x339.jpg alt width=1024 height=339 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The point is… instead of going with a generic weight loss topic for your site, go extremely niche and zone in on one market. Once you have this in place, you can then launch your site and go live with individual reviews on as many related topics/products as possible.</p><h3><strong>2&nbsp;– How to Make Money with Your Site</strong></h3><p>In addition to niching down your content and audience focus as much as possible, it’s also important to make sure you have a good way to make money with your site. In the case of ‘health, beauty and weight loss’, affiliate marketing is going to be one of the best options for you to run with. Many of the top selling products out there already have affiliate programs in place, or you can simply join an affiliate network like <a href=# rel=noopener>Adcombo</a> that already has over 100 healthy, beauty and weight loss offers to choose from.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/adcombo-health-offers-1024x495.jpg alt width=1024 height=495 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As you can see, within Adcombo you will find a wide range of health and weight loss offers that fall into each of the broken down niche categories below. The more affiliate networks you join, the more weight loss related offers you can find. People are likely already searching for reviews and trial offers on these offers, so that would be the main focus of your site and where you would be providing value to your audience and monetizing your content at the same time.</p><p>You will also notice that many of these offers on Adcombo are marked with [FERRARI]. This is because of their latest affiliate content where they are <a href=#>giving away a $200,000 Ferrari California</a> to their top affiliate, and a bunch of other great products to other top performing affiliates. This promotion is running right now and ends in May, so there is still plenty of time to earn some good money and walk away with a nice prize in the process.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/adcombo-prizes.jpg alt width=996 height=274 sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>3&nbsp;– Go Live with Your Content and Promote It Like Crazy</strong></h3><p>Now that we covered the basics of coming up with a niche focus for your health review site, and how you can start monetizing it through the use of affiliate offers, it’s time to focus on your content creation and content promotion.</p><p>Before going live with content on your site, there are a few things you need to remember. The first and most important is that the internet is already overloaded with content. Don’t just put content out there simply to go live with content, instead, create mega articles, guides, and reviews that provide real value. This is really the only way you can compete nowadays. In short, focus on quality content, as this will help with the whole backlinking and promotion strategy as well.</p><p>If you want to see how the top sites are doing this, simply Google “<a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss pills reviews 2017</a>” and take a look at the sites ranking on the first page of Google. Reviews.com is a great example of how to do this. Not only do they have great content and rank organically, they are also earning commission on most mentions of products within their content as well.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/best-weight-loss-pills-1024x656.jpg alt width=1024 height=656 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Once you’ve created some content for your site, it’s time to start thinking about how you can start promoting it. Unfortunately, it will take some time for a new website or blog to rank in Google (at least anywhere decent), but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get started with an aggressive marketing campaign right away. Best of all, I know many affiliate marketers and site owners are working on a small or limited budget, so there are plenty of ways you can put your own time and effort to work on this, instead of just spending money on paid traffic sources and hoping for the best.</p><p>Here are a few content marketing ideas to help you get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Health Related Expert Roundup</strong> – This is a no-brainer, and it’s also <a href=#>something I talk about all the time</a>. If you want to increase your DA/PA, backlinks, traffic and social shares, run a health related expert roundup on your site. Simply ask a question to a bunch of industry experts or bloggers within your space, then post all of their responses in one big mega post on your site.&nbsp;Many of the experts you feature within your article will then go on to share the content and maybe even link to it from their own sites. This works great because everyone sharing and linking to your content is already likely within the health and weight loss industry.</li><li><strong>Create a Weight Loss Infographics</strong> – Infographics are great for marketing and they are pretty easy to create as well. Simply look for some of the latest stats or industry reports on anything you are currently focused on, then head over to a site like Canva.com and use their free templates to create an infographic. After that, submit your image to a <a href=# rel=noopener>bunch of infographic directories</a>, then reach out to other health bloggers to see if they would like to share it with their audience as well. To improve your chances for the infographic getting picked up on other sites, offer a free original article and social sharing to anyone willing to post it.</li><li><strong>Become an Expert within Your Space</strong> – Everyone is always looking for expert advice and tips, especially when it’s related to weight loss and health. Use sites like <a href=# rel=noopener>Quora</a> or Facebook Groups to provide feedback to different audiences around the world. There are already millions of users searching for answers on these sites, you just need to provide your feedback and give the best information possible. The more answers and feedback you can provide, the more likely to increase your authority and trust within the industry.</li></ul><p>Other advanced content marketing options include guest blogging, retargeting advertising and bidding on long tail keywords through Google Adwords. Be sure to expand into these different areas when looking to scale your site and it’s content to that next level.</p><h3><strong>The Path to a Successful Affiliate Health Site</strong></h3><p>When it comes to building any type of content and affiliate site on the internet, it’s all about niching down as much as possible and ranking for longtail keywords. This goes right back to knowing who your audience is and making sure you can provide them with the best information possible.</p><p>If you are going to launch your first website or blog today, don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results right away. Just like anything in life worth doing, it’s going to take some time and effort on your part. This has been a proven method that works time and time again. Focus on writing killer product reviews, then getting that content in front of the right audience. If you are relying solely on SEO, this is going to take some time and effort, so don’t get discouraged when you don’t see results right away.</p><p>Go live with your site today. Create content that provides value, and then focus even more on the content promotion aspect to see real results.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunC5wKScZqWfo7K6eceemKWsmGLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dqLa1sY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-la-desilusi%C3%B3n-del-tiempo-by-ill%C3%A1n-iberra-a-real-book-what-is-the-importance-of-it.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is La Desilusin Del Tiempo By Illn Iberra A Real Book?
