With Pascal starring in The Mandalorian and the HBO drama series The Last of Us and Paulson <a href=#>dominating in nine seasons of Ryan Murphy's anthology series </a><a href=#>American Horror Story,</a> we know the pair as two of the most popular actors in Hollywood. With both of their respective successes, it's hard to think of a day when they weren't the "in-demand" actors they are now. But toward the beginning of <strong><a href=#>Pedro Pascal </a></strong>and Sarah Paulson's friendship in New York, success wasn't always on the radar for the actors, specifically for Pascal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gen Z fans have adoringly dubbed Paulson and Pascal </a>as "Mommy and Daddy," and though they aren't actually a couple, their relationship has seen them operate in a similar fashion. Back in their early days in New York City, Pedro Pascal's career wasn't as promising as it now appears. The actor was down in the dumps. In fact, Pascal would have likely hit rock bottom if it weren't for Paulson, whose generosity back in the day helped the actor when he couldn't find work in Hollywood. And, aren't we glad she did? Here's how Sarah Paulson helped her longtime pal Pedro Pascal early on in his career.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-2023-03-13t212800-777.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Best Bromance Moments From Pedro Pascal And Oscar Isaac's Relationship</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There's love, there's romance and then there's Pedro Pascal and Oscar Isaac's bromance.</span><h2 id=how-pedro-pascal-and-sarah-paulson-became-friends>How Pedro Pascal And Sarah Paulson Became Friends</h2><p>It all began in New York City in 1993. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 conversation between Pedro Pascal and Sarah Paulson</a> for Interview magazine, the Narcos star revealed<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the duo met in September 1993 when he had just moved to New York City</a>. "I was really lucky because my first friend at NYU lived in Brooklyn, Kristen, and went to high school with you, so your guys' posse kind of adopted me," Pascal told Paulson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of their earliest memories, Pascal recalls, was the pair and their friends all going to see the film Fearless in The Upper East Side. "There were eight of us sitting next to each other and, as I remember, we were all sobbing by the end of it," Pascal recalled. After finishing the movie, they all went to the park, where they just so happened to see actor Woody Harrelson.</p><p>"We were the two people who knew exactly who he was and fanned out a little bit. Nobody else cared," Pascal said. "We had our little celebrity sighting moment and that, in retrospect, was our first step towards bonding."</p><p>The gang of friends gallivanted about New York City, continuing their wild night. Pascal remembered the group "running down Fifth Avenue" and "getting knocked down by a cabbie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember that so clearly," Paulson said. "It's a wonder we survived. When I think about the debauchery, the things that we did, the kind of sh*t we were pulling and the way we were behaving, I don't even know how we made it to the next morning, much less 20 years later."</p><p>Believe it or not, the pair's friendship saw a time when they went through a "period of estrangement," wherein their lives diverted them apart from one another. But not to worry, it wasn't because there was a quarrel of sort between them. "I think we went through a period where we didn't talk as much, but it was never because we were fighting," Paulson said.</p><p>Pascal explained it was because Paulson moved to Los Angeles to further pursue her acting career. "You were the first of all of us that started working and never stopped," he said.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar35374165.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sarah Paulson And Sandra Bullock Once Bonded Over This Sad Experience</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sarah Paulson and Sandra Bullock have more than movies in common.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-paulson-used-to-give-pedro-pascal-money-so-that-he-could-eat>Sarah Paulson Used To Give Pedro Pascal Money So That He Could Eat</h2><p>Pedro Pascal struggled in the early days of his career and Sarah Paulson was there for him in such a heartfelt way. Like the song "That's What Friends Are For" says, "In good times and bad times, I'll be on your side forever more," Paulson helped her Pascal out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by lending him money in his times of need</a>. She told Esquire their friendship was solid enough that she could give him money while he auditioned for work. This was around the early 2000s.</p><p>"He’s talked about this publicly, but there were times when I would give him my per diem from a job I was working on so that he could have money to feed himself," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-09t123700-836.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pascal admitted to being worried his career would never take off — especially in those early years when his gigs were few and far between.</p><p>"I died so many deaths," he told Esquire. "My vision of it was that if I didn’t have some major exposure by the time I was twenty-nine years old, it was over, so I was constantly readjusting what it meant to commit my life to this profession, and giving up the idea of it looking like I thought it would when I was a kid. There were so many good reasons to let that delusion go."</p><p>Pascal eventually saw success come his way when he scored his first acting role ever on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which he celebrated as a massive success. "I was so excited to be on it, mostly because people in my life that I respected so much, my best friends and my sister, were obsessed with the show. Obsessed with it. I wasn’t watching it at the time," he explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pedro-pascal-and-nicholas-cage-in-the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Are Nicolas Cage And Pedro Pascal Friends After Working Together On The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicolas Cage and Pedro Pascal met on the set of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, & fans are curious if the two developed a friendship on set.</span><h2 id=have-sarah-paulson-and-pedro-pascal-ever-dated>Have Sarah Paulson And Pedro Pascal Ever Dated?</h2><p>With Sarah Paulson and Pedro Pascal's rich history together considered, it's obvious that fans have speculated if the pair had ever been romantically involved.

After Paulson and Letts broke up, she went on to fall for the actor Holland Taylor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Pascal, his dating history is a bit more ambiguous. From what we know, Pascal has never been married does a fairly good job of keeping it a secret <a href=#>whether he is someone's husband or boyfriend</a>. With many fans determined to figure out who the actor is romantically involved with, Pascal has kept a relatively low profile when it has come to his love life. In the past, Pascal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been linked in the press to several women</a> including Simi Khadra, Maria Dizzia, and Robin Tunney. Most notably, it was reported that Pascal dated the actor who played his Game of Thrones character's sworn enemy, Lena Headey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnpyipHqxrdKcmKVlo5a%2ForSMqZiupKOku26y0aKcp5yjnbaxecSaqaWxXZius7HEq2SfmZOpwHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennifer-aniston-without-makeup-shows-off-new-bob-haircut-picture.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennifer Aniston Without Makeup, Shows Off New Bob Haircut: Picture</a>
