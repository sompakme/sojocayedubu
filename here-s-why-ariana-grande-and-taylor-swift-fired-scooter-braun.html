His main claim to fame is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discovering Justin Bieber</a> on YouTube. Today, Justin Bieber and Karlie Kloss are some of Scooter’s most famous clients. He manages their careers with tremendous skill, intelligence, and vision. However, some sources and reporters claim this man has a history of taking his influence on his clients too far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are times he oversteps into their personal zones and that leads to unpleasant consequences. It happened with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p>Ariana terminated her contract with Scooter once. Though the manager placed the blame on other things, sources reveal that the crux of the matter was Scooter’s unprofessionalism.</p><p>In a recent incident, there was an open tiff between Scooter and one more celebrity musician, which attracted a lot of attention from fans and the media. Taylor Swift accused him of trying to put her down.</p><p>Now, let's look at the chronological events that led to Ariana and Swift’s&nbsp;bumpy relationship with Scooter Braun.</p><h2 id=the-backstory-to-swift-and-scooter-rift><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><span class=related-single>The Backstory To Swift And Scooter Rift</span></span></h2><p>First, we need to talk about the backstory. In 2016, Kim Kardashian released a recorded phone call on her show, between Kanye West and Taylor Swift. West later released a video for his track,&nbsp;Famous, where he featured a naked wax model which resembled Swift, along with nude wax figures of other celebs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During that telephone call, West asked Swift for permission to use certain lyrics about her in the song, "Famous", and she seemed to agree.</p><h2 id=scooter-s-acquisition-of-big-machine-started-it-all><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Scooter's Acquisition Of Big Machine Started It All</span></h2><p>This incident was connected to a series of events that took place three years later. In June of 2019, Scooter Braun purchased Big Machine, the renowned music label, for 300 million dollars, as per reports from the Wall Street Journal. The previous owner of Big Machine was Scott Borchetta, who signed Taylor Swift in 2005. When Scooter bought the company, he became the owner of all of Taylor's tracks.</p><h2 id=taylor-s-master-tracks-went-to-scooter><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Taylor's Master Tracks Went To Scooter</span></h2><p>Scooter now owned all of Swift's videos and master tracks from 2006 to 2017. In 2018, Swift left Big Machine and joined Republic Records. She left behind all of her work. Later, she wished to purchase Big Machine, along with her father, but the deal did not go through. Instead, the label was bought by Scooter Braun. This upset Swift enormously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift Uses Her Billboard Woman Of The Decade Platform To Bash Scooter Braun</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-claimed-she-was-bullied-by-scooter-braun><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Taylor Swift Claimed She Was Bullied By Scooter Braun</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift began publishing public statements that explained how she felt about the Big Machine deal. She claimed that she was continuously bullied by Scooter and his clients and friends on social media. She said she never imagined that her master tracks would end up being owned by the man who would always try and hurt her.</p><h2 id=taylor-claimed-they-showed-her-naked-to-ruin-her><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Taylor Claimed They Showed Her Naked To Ruin Her</span></h2><p>Swift then referenced the 2016 Kim Kardashian and Kanye West incident. She claimed that West, with support from Scooter, was trying to dismantle her career by portraying her naked in what she considered a 'revenge porn' music video. West was indeed Scooter’s client. She showed her annoyance towards both men.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Taylor Swift Album Is Being Released...

She posted a picture on Tumblr of West, Braun, and Bieber, and claimed all of them were trying to ruin her. Bieber is a loyal client of Scooter's and has been for a long time. Bieber posted a reaction to Swift’s claim on Instagram. Initially, Bieber apologized, but then went on to defend Braun.</p><h2 id=bieber-reacted-on-instagram><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bieber Reacted On Instagram</span></h2><p>Bieber wrote on Swift’s Insta post that claims against Scooter could cause trouble for Scooter and his family. He feared Swift’s fan club would now attempt to get revenge on Scooter, which might be dangerous. He added that he would like to talk to Swift and Scooter to resolve the issues.</p><h2 id=there-were-two-fighting-squads><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>There Were Two Fighting Squads</span></h2><p>Swift refused to discuss the issue with Scooter and his supporters. The feud went on. There were two squads on two sides. On Swift’s side, there were celebs like Haim and Allesia. On Scooter’s side were Demi Lovato and Bieber. Bieber’s prediction came true, and Swift’s fans did start bullying Scooter and his family. Scooter’s wife began considering getting police protection to safeguard her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=swift-blamed-scooter-and-borchetta-for-manipulating><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Swift Blamed Scooter And Borchetta For Manipulating</span></h2><p>Swift went on with her allegations. She claimed that she wished to sing a medley of her old songs that belonged to Big Machine at the AMA ceremony, but Scooter and Borchetta would not allow it. She further claimed that the two men declined an offer from Netflix to use her old tracks in a documentary that they wished to make about her.</p><h2 id=ariana-came-into-the-picture><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ariana Came Into The Picture</span></h2><p>Ariana Grande, another gifted singer, had a long collaboration with Scooter Braun that started in 2013. He managed her entire career, along with running Republic Records. She posted a picture of a party that was held to celebrate Braun’s acquisition of Big Machine on Instagram. However, as soon as Swift’s post came up on Tumblr (Taylor accused Scooter of trying to damage her career), Ariana took down her Instagram post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-fired-scooter-in-the-past><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ariana Fired Scooter In The Past</span></h2><p>Ariana wanted Scooter and Swift to talk and put an end to the feud. There was a time when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana had her own issues with Scooter</a>, but they got past their problems. In 2016, she fired Braun. Though some called it a ‘misunderstanding,’ most media sources, including Us Weekly, said that this happened because Scooter was interfering with her personal life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Not-So-Sweet Facts About Ariana Grande</a></span></p><h2 id=braun-paid-the-price-for-overstepping><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Braun Paid The Price For Overstepping</span></h2><p>After signing Scooter as her manager, Ariana’s fame shot to new heights. Ariana was dating and was supposed to get engaged soon, which probably did not go over well with her manager. Scooter reportedly overstepped into her private life while trying to manage her professional career. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana fired him</a> as she hated the interference. She set up a new boundary.</p><h2 id=scooter-blamed-ariana-s-ex><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Scooter Blamed Ariana’s Ex</span></h2><p>Ariana and Scooter got back together within six months. Speaking to Variety, Scooter blamed Ariana’s ex-boyfriend for their rift and said things were resolved when that man left. Ariana called Braun to talk things out and that resolved everything. The new bond between them was stronger than it had been before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=report-of-ariana-s-involvement-were-fake><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Report Of Ariana’s Involvement Were Fake</span></h2><p>A previously mentioned, Ariana removed her Instagram post regarding Scooter’s acquisition of Big Machine after Swift’s Tumblr event, as she did not wish to get involved with the mess.</p><p>A report once showed a screenshot of Ariana’s Instagram post, claiming she was strictly on Taylor’s side, and this screenshot began circulating on social media.
