href=#>basketball career</a> in 2011 hit the jackpot and became a hugely successful businessman. Today, Shaq is one of the wealthiest athletes in the world; his net worth is $400 mln. Are you impressed? It's no time yet. Here's what you need to know about his mind-blowing success in the business sphere.</p><h2 id=the-many-businesses-of-shaq>The Many&nbsp;Businesses Of Shaq</h2><p>Let's start with the entities he has bought and now owns. Here are the numbers: 17 Auntie Anne's Pretzels restaurants, 155 Five Guys Burgers and Fries <a href=#>franchises</a>, 150 car washes, Las Vegas <a href=#>nightclubs</a>, 40 24-hour fitness gyms, the Met Miami, a movie theater, a brokerage startup Loyal3, and many more!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shaq cooperates with so many brands, it's barely possible to count their number. For example, in 2019, he joined <a href=#>Papa John's</a> board of directors (surprise-surprise, <a href=#>he bought nine locations in the Atlantic area</a>). There's even a Shaq-A-Claus, an initiative from Toys'R'us. One more fun collab, <a href=#>the basketball star teamed up with Carnival Cruise Line</a> and got a unique, new title: CFO or Chief Fun Officer. Moving on, did you try Soda Shaq? It's a low-calorie soda of <a href=#>AriZona beverages</a>. Or maybe you played the computer <a href=#>game</a> Shaq Fu? It's pretty old, though, released in 1994. Anyways, this list can be endless!</p><p>There's one curious thing about cooperations. Do you know Shaq is picky about whom to work with? For instance, he refused to collaborate with <a href=#>Starbucks</a> because "black people don't drink coffee." "If I don't like something, people will notice it anyway," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writes Basketballnoise.com.</a>&nbsp;Well, it's better to be honest with customers, right?</p><p>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaq's Kitchen: Restaurants With Ties To Shaquille O'Neal</a></p><h2 id=about-catching-the-hook>About Catching the Hook</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>O'Neal started dealing with business long before he was into it. For example, in 1992, he made a $15 mln deal with <a href=#>Reebok</a>. Or in 2004, Shaq was among the first who invested in <a href=#>Google</a>. But, <a href=#>recalling those times</a>, the star confessed regretting he didn't buy more shares. Another curious thing is that Shaq is <a href=#>Twitter's</a>&nbsp;first verified user. He found out about it accidentally <a href=#>during an interview</a>. "I was talking to a reporter and he said something nasty about me and he said he read a quote. I said "Yo, don't you ever misquote me." He said "you said it on Twitter." I said "what the hell is Twitter?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he&nbsp;told Fast Company.</a>&nbsp;Well, he worked hard to get what he has these days.</p><h2 id=the-path-to-success>The Path to Success</h2><p>You can have an impression that Shaq's very lucky. Well, he made an effort to achieve what he has. He started with small steps by buying a copy of The Dummies Guide To Building A Business which eventually led to his first successful deal with Reebok (the one from 1992). Later on, he got his <a href=#>MA in Business at the University of Phoenix</a>, and that's when his <a href=#>franchise empire</a> started developing. In 2018, <a href=#>the basketball star founded Big Chicken</a>, a chicken sandwich brand with ten locations in LA, and since 2021 it's expanded in Austin and Phoenix. Today, he holds The Shaq Summit, an annual meeting of <a href=#>representatives</a>&nbsp;of the companies that are part of O'Neal's holding. Oh, yes, and he's DJing as well. "I just try my best to lead by example in everything I do," he said in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">live Q + A session during The Playbook 2021 conducted by Trainual.com.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal Sells Florida Home For $11M, Half Of The Asking Price After 3 Years</a></p><h2 id=shaq-s-business-mottos>Shaq's Business Mottos</h2><p>Okay, since now it's clear what 'The Big Aristotle,' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as he proclaimed himself</a>, has, here are some ideas that help him be among the best. <a href=#>As Trainual.com writes</a>, he's a life-long learner, which means he's constantly learning something new. For example, for now, he's into <a href=#>NFTs </a>and <a href=#>cryptocurrencies</a>. Another step is to use the opportunities life gives to you. "If I were losing games [at the time], I wouldn't have taken advantage of these opportunities. I would have focused on my game," he said on the Playbook 2021. Additionally, it's essential to be a team player. You know he's doing his business with the help of others, right? "[Perhaps] my greatest attribute is that I always hire people smarter than me. I love not being the smartest person in the room," he shared. Finally, the idea of believing in yourself and your actions requires no words, "Not many people know this. But the game [of basketball] is 85% mental and 15% skill."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from making money and entertaining people, the basketball star spends enough time and money on <a href=#>charity</a>. He contributes to several ones, like Be The Match, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Kids Wish Network. There's also a <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal Foundation</a> that supports 'underserved youth to achieve their full potential.' Yep, Shaq seems to be a busy guy.</p><p>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Drake Snags Rare Michael Jordan Cards Potentially Worth $1 Million</a></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Trainual.com</a>, <a href=#>Franchise500.com</a>, <a href=#>Basketballnoise.com</a>, <a href=#>Eu.usatoday.com</a>, <a href=#>Thehustle.co,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Fastcompany.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAqa3QZqCnnKWowbO1xKxkoqajnrGmedOhnGaaop65rbXAp6tmmqWotq%2Bx0qxkpqGemXqwsoysn5qppZ65rbGMqKWemZxk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lachlan-nieboer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lachlan Nieboer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a>
