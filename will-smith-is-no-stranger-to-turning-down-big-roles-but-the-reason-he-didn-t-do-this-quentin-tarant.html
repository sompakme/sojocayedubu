The film would go on to gross $426 million and earn his co-star Christoph Waltz his second Oscar.</p><p>Will Smith had previously explained that, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was about the creative direction of the story</a>."

That idea is perfect."</p><p>Smith wasn't happy with the fact that Dr. King Schultz (played by Waltz) had such an important role in the movie. "Django wasn’t the lead, so it was like, I need to be the lead. The other character was the lead!"</p><p>He also wanted <strong><a href=#>Quentin Tarantino </a></strong>to rewrite the ending, so he gets revenge on the plantation owner: "I was like, ‘No, Quentin, please, I need to kill the bad guy!"</p><p>Will Smith still has no regrets about turning down the role.

Smith admitted he felt the weight of the role during filming. “I went too far in Emancipation,” Smith revealed to Kevin Hart on his chat series Hart To Hart. “Just bringing it up, I start to get teary.
