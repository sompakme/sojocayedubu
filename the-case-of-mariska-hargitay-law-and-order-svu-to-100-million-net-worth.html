Unit</a>. As a female officer whose role is to work with special victims of heinous crimes, the material is often intense, and she has really become attached to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helping real life victims of such crimes</a>, outside of her role on television. Hargitay's long-term dedication to the show has led her to her current&nbsp;&nbsp;net worth of $100 million, and she is considered to be among the highest paid women on television. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fandom </a>reports that as&nbsp; a young actress, Hargitay appeared in a series of other productions and shows&nbsp; before&nbsp;appearing on Law & Order SVU&nbsp;in 1999.

Her mother, and 2 other adult passengers were killed in the devastating crash, and miraculously, the children all survived.</p><p>Mariska was so incredibly young at the time of this incident that she doesn't have a conscious recollection of it, but she definitely grew up with the significant void of not having her mother by her side.
