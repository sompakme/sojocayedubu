While the family seems supportive of one another, Sam and his dad moved to the United States; Mike Asghari first, his son later at age 12.</p><p>Sam's sisters stayed in Tehran with his mom Fatima, though the family was later reunited. In interviews, Sam has talked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much his family means to him</a>, and what they sacrificed to ensure he had more opportunities than they did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Men's Health, Sam shared, "When great things happen to me, it only motivates me and puts me in a position where I have to work even harder. I think about how far my family came, and everything they sacrificed for me to be here, so I never take anything for granted."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Britney Spears And Sam Asghari’s Relationship As Perfect As It Seems?</a></span></p><p>Asghari elaborated that while Spears is an inspiration to him, as she is so humble despite everything she has accomplished in life, it's always been his priority to support his family. At the time, in 2018, Sam and Britney weren't married yet—and much of her conservatorship was still under wraps.</p><p>For Sam, a deeper connection was already there; "I grew up with three sisters, and my personality is just to be a supportive person for my family and she’s family. I’m always going to support her.
