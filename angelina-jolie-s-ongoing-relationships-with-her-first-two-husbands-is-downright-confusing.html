In reality, however, Jolie was involved in several other relationships that got a lot of people talking before she was first linked with Pitt.</p><p>Like most people, <a href=#>Jolie has had relationships with several people</a>. On top of that, some people may have forgotten the fact that before Jolie and Pitt got married, Angelina walked down the aisle with two other people in the past.</p><p>Given that Jolie's first two marriages ended decades ago, it makes sense that a lot of people don't think about them any longer. That said, if people learn more about Jolie's current relationship with her first two husbands, they may conclude something really confusing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-angelina-jolie-39-s-relationship-with-her-first-husband-jonny-lee-miller-like-now>What Is Angelina Jolie's Relationship With Her First Husband, Jonny Lee Miller, Like Now?</h2><p>In the year 1995, an over-the-top movie about computer hackers was released and immediately flopped critically and commercially. Since then, the movie Hackers has become something of a cult classic because many people love its unique style.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Angelina Jolie And Jonny Lee Miller's Marriage</a></span></p><p>Despite how fun it is to see some people embrace Hackers, the truth is that it didn't do a lot to advance the careers of anyone involved with producing the movie at the time. However, that doesn't mean that all the film's stars didn't get anything out of the film.</p><p>After Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller played romantic interests in Hackers, the two actors fell for each other. After becoming a couple in 1994, Jolie and Miller tied the knot in 1996 and at that time they were one of the best-looking young couples in Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly for them, Jolie and Miller's relationship clearly wasn't meant to last. After 18 months of marriage, Miller and Jolie separated and then their union officially ended in the year 1999.</p><p>Almost twenty years after Jolie and Miller's marriage ended, Jonny starred in a sequel to his most beloved movie, Trainspotting. While promoting T2 Trainspotting in 2017, Miller was interviewed by Stuff New Zealand for a profile. During the resulting piece, Miller described himself in a way that may surprise some of his fans.</p><p>"Actually, shy is probably right. I'm a little bit more relaxed these days. But I guess I'm still not that comfortable sitting here talking about myself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jpg_20230316_151605_0000.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later during the same piece, Miller was quoted talking about his relationship with his ex-wife, Jolie. While Miller wasn't willing to talk about his relationship with his ex-wife in detail, he made it clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had a good relationship with Jolie</a>.</p><p>"Yeah – we're still friends. That's all you're getting."</p><p>As of the time of this writing, it has been just over six years since that piece was published. With that in mind, Miller and Jolie could have had a falling out since then. However, since 2017 was almost two decades after Jolie and Miller's divorce and they were friends, it seems unlikely that would have changed in recent years.</p><h2 id=what-is-angelina-jolie-39-s-relationship-with-her-second-husband-billy-bob-thornton-like-now>What Is Angelina Jolie's Relationship With Her Second Husband, Billy Bob Thornton, Like Now?</h2><p>After Jolie got to know her first husband while working on Hackers and her third husband while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith, she starred in the movie Pushing Tin. While Jolie was working on Pushing Tin, she got to know the actor Billy Bob Thornton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Billy Bob Thornton And Angelina Jolie Wore Those Infamous Blood Necklaces</a></span></p><p>Despite the fact that Thornton was twenty years older than Jolie, the two actors hit it off. Not long after, Jolie and Thornton walked down the aisle in the year 2000 and their relationship wound up garnering a slew of different headlines.</p><p>Most notably, Jolie and Thornton got a lot of people talking when they revealed that both of them had and wore a vial of each other's blood as a necklace. On top of that, a lot of people paid attention to the way that Thornton and Jolie appeared to be so passionately in love during their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-reason-billy-bob-thornton-and-angelina-jolie-wore-those-infamous-blood-necklaces.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Jolie and Thornton's marriage wasn't meant to be as they separated in 2002 and finalize their divorce the following year.</p><p>Roughly nineteen years after Thornton and Jolie's divorce, Billy Bob spoke when he was at the Tribeca TV Festival. When his relationship with Jolie came up, Thornton made it crystal clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he continued to be friends with Angelina</a>.</p><p>“We’re good friends. We’ve been friends for years and years and years. So we keep up with each other.

Ever since Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston ended and many people blamed Jolie, there have been a lot of people who've seen Angelina as a villain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt.jpg><p>Based on the way that many of those people perceive Jolie, it seems like she should have a totally toxic relationship with her ex-husbands.</p><p>With that in mind, you'd think that the fact that Jolie gets along great with her first two husbands would make a lot of people rethink their assumptions about her. For that reason, it is confusing that no matter what Jolie's exes say about her, some observers will never change their opinion of her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWKyuXnHrqqbmZ6Zequ7zaewZqSVmnqutculnKtlkp65rcWMm6abZaSdvLO606ilZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGK7sMOO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./aquarius-sun-with-cancer-moon-and-cancer-rising-truly-divine.html>&#171;&nbsp;Aquarius Sun with Cancer Moon and Cancer Rising Truly Divine</a>
