However, it seems like her relationship with Jimmy Fallon might be a little stronger compared to the other late night hosts. That was well-documented when Taylor Swift showed up at the last second after a request from Fallon's team, singing a tribute song to Jimmy's late mother.</p><p>The Tonight Show producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike DiCenzo detailed the emotional moment between the two</a>.</p><p>“She was not scheduled to do our show today. But we wanted something special for this first show back, so we asked her on a complete whim, since she had been in town doing SNL. She said yes with zero hesitation,” DiCenzo wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She sang ‘New Year’s Day.’ No one had heard it. Suddenly she sings the line, ‘Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi.’ I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing. I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. ‘Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,’ Taylor sang.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Recalls Being Told To Enter Russell Brand's Dressing Room With Caution Prior To Their Tonight Show Interview</a></span></p><p>DiCrenzo went on to reveal that the hug between the two was a 100% genuine heartfelt moment.
