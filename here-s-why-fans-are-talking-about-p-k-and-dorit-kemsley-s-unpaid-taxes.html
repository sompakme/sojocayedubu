Let's take a look at what people are saying.</p><h2 id=p-k-and-dorit-39-s-unpaid-taxes>P.K. And Dorit's Unpaid Taxes</h2><p>Fans love hearing about <a href=#>Dorit Kemsley and her sweet children</a>, but people are talking about her for a different reason now: the unpaid taxes that she and her husband are said to owe.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">P.K. And Dorit Kemsley owe unpaid taxes</a> and according to The Sun, a 2018 tax document says that the "outstanding balance" that is owed to the IRS is $$635,887.23. P.K. is said to owe $289,423.67 and the document is dated October 2018.</p><p>The publication says Dorit "has an individual tax lien from the State Of California for the amount of $90,269.46 which was most recently dated in March 2021."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Sun also reported that Dorit and P.K. owe $1,308,803.09 in unpaid taxes together.</p><p>People are also talking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dorit wanting to sell two mansions</a>. According to Radar Online, one house is 8,679 square feet and has 7 bathrooms and 5 bedrooms, and they're trying to sell it for $6.9 million. P.K. and Dorit tried to sell it after buying it in 2016 for $6,565.000. When the couple put it on the market again, they were asking $12,750,000, and in April 2020, they decided to try to sell it again. It hasn't been successful.</p><p>The second home that Dorit and P.K. want to sell is 8,901 square feet and it has 10 bathrooms and 6 bedrooms. The listing price is $7,995,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Erika Jayne Over-Spend Tom Girardi’s Massive Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>People have been wondering about Dorit and how much money she has for a while now. In one season 10 scene for The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, Dorit said that her house was in her name, not P.K.'s and when a producer asked her, she said, "What difference does that make?"</p><p>Dorit and P.K. talked about reports that have been in the press, and she kept saying that the "narrative" that the media has stuck to isn't the truth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Here's Why Fans Are Talking About Brandi Glanville Again</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one episode of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille Grammer brought up Dorit's money problems</a>, which definitely made this a very intense scene. No one could blame Dorit for not wanting anyone to talk about her finances.</p><p>According to People.com, Dorit found out that Camille had spoken about her finances to Lisa Rinna. Camille said, "It was before my 50th. I had to get to know you. I didn’t trust you. I didn’t know where you were getting all this money from.” Dorit didn't like hearing this and she asked, “What do you mean where I was getting all what money from?”</p><p>Things got more heated as Camille said, "People want to know what I know."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Camille mentioned that P.K. filed for bankruptcy before, Dorit said that was true and it was water under the bridge. She said, “My husband built a $2 billion business from zero" and she told the cameras during her confessional, "PK doesn’t owe any of your friends any money, sweetheart. You were sitting there talking about our financial state."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Erika Jayne's Legal Drama Is Being Dissected By The 'RHOBH' Cast</a></span></p><h2 id=dorit-and-lvp>Dorit And LVP</h2><p>When Dorit Kemsley began appearing on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, she, P.K., and Lisa Vanderpump were super close and had been for a long time. It's always great to see a cast member's good friend join, but it doesn't look like the two are anything close to best friends anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Us Weekly, Lisa Vanderpump had some harsh words for Dorit, who was excited about decorating a room in a restaurant. Lisa said, "I don’t think it's really a restaurateur when you decorate the dining room somewhere in a back space. I think that's vastly different than running restaurants. I hope it's more successful than her bikini business."</p><p>While Lisa's words are pretty negative, she and Dorit did have a lot of drama, as Dorit adopted a dog from Lisa Vanderpump's Vanderpump Dogs and famously found a different family for the dog to love with. This became "Puppygate" on RHOBH as the cast kept talking about different people's versions of events.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Insiders Say Denise Richards Was Once Blacklisted From 'Real Housewives'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2Kus7GMrZilo5mjtG6twaisrWWgoHqiusNmm6iqmal6rLHMrKOesaNiwq%2B8wKKbZqyRrbK0ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lil-nas-x-viral-hit-songs-advocacies-millions-in-the-bank.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lil Nas X: Viral Hit Songs, Advocacies, &amp;amp; Millions In The Bank</a>
