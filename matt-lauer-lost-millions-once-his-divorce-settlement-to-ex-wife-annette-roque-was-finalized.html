"Over the past two years people have asked why I have not spoken out to defend myself more vigorously against some of the false and salacious allegations leveled at me. It is a fair question and the answer is deeply personal."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Despite my desire to set the record straight and confront the individuals making false allegations, I wanted nothing less than to create more headlines my kids would read and a new gathering of photographers at the end of our driveway. But my silence has been a mistake."</p><p>In addition, Lauer has played the blame game, stating that most of the stories were exaggerated.</p><h2 id=the-finalized-divorce-settlement-saw-matt-lauer-fork-over-20-million-in-assets>The Finalized Divorce Settlement Saw Matt Lauer Fork Over $20 Million In Assets</h2><p>Back in 2019, Page Six discussed the details of the finalized divorce.
