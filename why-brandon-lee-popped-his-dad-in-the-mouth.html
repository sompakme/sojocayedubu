Not the kind of classy trailer park <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson</a> used to live in, but the kind of trailer park where the single wides have rusted siding and banged up pick up trucks parked outside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A while back, seems Pamela Anderson gave an interview and talked about some stuff that her ex-husband rocker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tommy Lee</a> objected to big time. Of course, he clapped back and insulted her on social media.</p><p>Now, Dylan Lee <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson'</a>s&nbsp; 20-year-old so took it in his stride. He wasn't happy, but hey, that's just life he said. Older brother Brandon Lee had a completely different reaction. And it ended up with Tommy Lee getting a busted lip.</p><p>It kind of blew up from there and got really nasty. You can't pop somebody like Tommy Lee in the mouth and expect him to say thanks for the experience.</p><p>So why did Brandon get so hot under the collar? Read on. Here's why he busted his aging rocker dad in the chops. Seems Tommy Lee was in bed with his very young fiancée at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pamela-talks-tommy-s-assault-in-tv-interview>Pamela Talks Tommy's Assault In TV Interview</h2><p>Pamela Anderson is a 50-something (going on 30) actress whose best days are behind her. So, if she wants to get publicity, she has to get sensational. She did an interview with English journalist and Meghan Markle hater Piers Morgan in which she discussed Tommy Lee's 1998 assault on her. The two were famously married from 1995 to 1998, producing Brandon and Dylan. Early on in their relationship, theirs was one of the early saucy "tapes" that leaked. They were a raunchy, sexy couple. Brandon and Dylan spent a whole lot more time with Pamela than Tommy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Pamela Anderson Really Live In A Trailer Park?</a></span></p><p>Anyway, when things started falling apart in 1998, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tommy kind of laid into Pamela. </a>&nbsp;Let's not mince words, he assaulted her. He pleaded "no contest" and went to jail for six months. It's not the kind of thing you need reminding of. And Tommy took exception to Pammie's bringing it up again, more than 20 years after the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He took to Twitter tweeting,&nbsp; “Think she’d find something new to discuss instead of rehashing old s*** but I guess she has nothing else going on & needs attention. Signed, ‘The Abuser’ (who she texts everyday & asks for me back).”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts About Tommy Lee And Pamela Anderson's Kids</a></span></p><p>Brandon saw red. He was so mad that he couldn't see straight. He was going to defend the honor of his mom. Nobody told him it was way too late for that. Brandon is a good looking 20-something guy, an actor, and a model who has worked for Dolce and Gabbana. But he's not long on common sense and anger management.</p><p>Next thing you know, Tommy is posting a picture of his fat, bloodied lip on&nbsp;Instagram.&nbsp;He laid it on pretty thick saying,&nbsp; "My heart is broken. You can give your kids everything they could ever want in their entire lives and they can still turn against you. Good job Brandon! Great son."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trolls jumped on Tommy's case for airing the dirty family laundry in public and he deleted the post. Let's look at the saga of Tommy Lee's busted lip.</p><h2 id=so-what-really-happened-between-tommy-and-brandon>So What REALLY Happened Between Tommy And Brandon?</h2><p>Tommy Lee was adamant that his son had launched an unprovoked attack on him. Brandon had a different story. Brandon claimed self-defense. Seems his version involved a drunken Tommy lunging at him.</p><p>Trailer park enough for you? It gets better, or worse, depending on your point of view.</p><p>Tommy tweeted:&nbsp; “My fiancée and I were in bed when my son busted into the room and assaulted me. I asked him to leave the house and he knocked me unconscious. He ran away from the police. THAT’S the truth.”</p><p>Well, 50-something Tommy's fiancée, now wife, 30-something Brittany Furlan called 911. The cops descended on Tommy Calabasas home. You know Calabasas, where the Kardashians live. Not exactly the wrong side of the tracks.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 19 Photos Of Tommy Lee And Brittany Furlan That Prove Age Is Just A Number</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Dylan is freaking out and Brandon is huffing and puffing. Dylan posted to&nbsp;Instagram, referring to LANY's song "Walk Away". Like there's a hint for Tommy and Brandon.</p><p>Across the ocean in France, Pamela, all loved up with French boy toy footballer Anil Rami, was said to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"heartbroken" and a "nervous wreck"</a>. Apparently, she thought Tommy Lee was a lousy dad. Well, no dad at all, actually. But wait. Seems there is a happy ending.</p><p>Fast forward to 2019 and Heidi Montag's pretty dreadful reality TV show&nbsp;The Hills: New Beginnings. Brandon made the occasional appearance and in one episode he is filmed having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lunch with Pamela, telling her it's hard to hold a grudge</a>. It's the kind of scripted chit chat you hear all the time on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Pamela&nbsp;puts the concerned reality TV mom face on and pats his hand. Next thing you know there's an&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;post of Brandon and Tommy Lee hugging. So, a happy ending?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to etonline.com, the two may have spent some quality quarantine time together in 2020. Tommy posted pictures of dad and son at his home smoking and lifting weights, saying "don't try this at home kids"</p><p>Don't you just love a happy ending? No word on what Pam thought about it. By the way, she ditched Rami and is back modeling her&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;swimsuit for dates in Malibu.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 20 Things About Tommy Lee That People Always Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmqWVoa5urc2dnKurn6N6t3nTqKSmsV2hsqZ51qGwZpqilrulu81mo56dXaW8sbzEnWShoaNisaKwjKKlZqyYmnquu9Stn2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./amy-mickelson-phil-mickelson-s-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-husband-net-worth-breast-can.html>&#171;&nbsp;Amy Mickelson (Phil Mickelsons Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Breast Can</a>
