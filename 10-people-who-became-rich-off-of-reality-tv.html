rich and famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reality TV stars are bringing in thousands of dollars per episode--their pay checks rarely reflecting any real talent, but more the hard earned result of life decisions, like teen pregnancies, large and unusual family dynamics, questionable backwoods lifestyles and excessive partying.</p><p>Although reality TV fame doesn't guarantee a successful career in the spotlight, an increasing amount of today's "stars" are getting their big breaks on networks like MTV and TLC. And many are capitalizing on their fifteen minutes, using their now famous names for book deals, advertisement gigs, speaking engagements and music careers.</p><p>A small slice of the "talent" below is just that, actual talent. But most of these now wealthy celebrities made their money the new-fashioned way: living out their unique lifestyles for all of us at home to watch.</p><h2 id=heidi-montag---net-worth-100-000>10.

She soon split with Conrad for boyfriend and future husband <a title="Spencer Pratt Net Worth" href=#>Spencer Pratt</a>. The two became known as "Spiedi," the villains of the show, terrorizing The Hills with their drama. Heidi, wanting to be known as a sex symbol in Hollywood, famously underwent&nbsp;ten plastic surgery&nbsp;procedures&nbsp;in one day, including breast enlargements, liposuction, chin reshaping, nose job and 'back scooped out'. Speidi's "fame" was short lived, however, and the couple blew all of their hard earned reality TV millions. All isn't lost however, according to TMZ, they will soon be starring in an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap. Montag is currently estimated to be worth $100,000.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kody-brown-and-the-sisterwives---net-worth-300-thousand>9.
