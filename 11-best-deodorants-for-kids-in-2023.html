Surely at their young age, an adult product isn’t an appropriate choice for them? The reason kids may need deodorant is the same as the reason why adults should—to prevent and eliminate body odor. Body odor is caused when sweat released from the sweat glands mixes with the bacteria on our skin. The bacteria starts converting the protein molecules in the sweat into acid, and this is what causes a smell. This can happen just about anywhere on the body; however, the most common places are the underarms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As children get older and more active, their sweat glands become more active, increasing the likelihood and strength of body odor. It is good hygiene and social practice to do your best to eliminate any body odor you might be producing, and teaching your kids this is an important step in their journey of growing up and learning to take care of themselves.</span></p><h3><span>How does deodorant work?</span></h3><p><span>Deodorant works by using an alcohol-based formula to change the skin’s pH to be slightly acidic. This makes the skin an unlivable environment for the bacteria that causes body odor, thus stopping the protein molecule breakdown into the acid process, and ultimately eliminating and preventing body odor from occurring. It is important to note that with a deodorant, your skin still sweats, differing from an antiperspirant which stops you from sweating altogether. However, the two are often combined, with many “antiperspirant deodorant” products available.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>What should you look out for in a kids deodorant?&nbsp;</span></h3><h4><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></h4><p><span>Children have sensitive skin, and, due to their age, they shouldn’t be exposed to an excessive number of chemicals and harsh ingredients. This means that when choosing a deodorant for your young one, you should aim for something that has a barebones formula as possible and focuses on simple and natural ingredients.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A common deodorant ingredient is aluminum; however, even some adults aim to avoid this chemical in their products. Aluminum salts work by dissolving on the skin and plugging up your pores, preventing sweat from escaping and thus stopping the creation of body odor. While they are extremely effective, several recent studies have raised concerns by suggesting that frequent application of aluminum onto the skin could have a link to some forms of cancer, including breast cancer. Aluminum is also thought to be the cause of the white and yellow stains that appear on clothes after using deodorant.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Parabens are another common deodorant ingredient that has potential concerns. Parabens are used in deodorants as an antibacterial agent, preserving the product’s shelf life. However, some concerns applying products that include parabens can change how the body produces the hormone estrogen, which can be detrimental to health in the long term.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While the conclusions of the research for both ingredients aren’t concrete, it is better to be safe than sorry, especially when the health of young children is involved. Therefore we suggest you look out for aluminum and paraben-free products when picking a deodorant for your little one, as this will give you the peace of mind that they are not using anything potentially harmful.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><strong>Application</strong></h4><p><span>Another thing to think about when shopping for a kid’s deodorant is the type of applicator. Children, especially younger ones, may still struggle with coordination, so you must pick something they can use safely. Choosing something easy to use will also allow your child to use the product independently, giving them a confidence boost.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Aerosol cans are usually not a good idea for young children as there is a lot of room for potential misapplication. You want a product that is easy and fun to use. Therefore, a roll-on or stick deodorant is likely the best choice. The best idea is to simply ask your child what they think will work best for them, and perhaps even try out a few different styles of product to see what works best for them and their routine. The easier it is to apply, the more encouraged they will be to use it themselves and remember to apply it every morning.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Should I buy an antiperspirant?&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span>Many deodorants are often a deodorant/antiperspirant hybrid, and you might be wondering if these are appropriate for your child. While the decision is ultimately up to you, there are a few things to consider here.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>An antiperspirant works by blocking sweat altogether. While this is a great solution for an adult who struggles with excessive sweating, this isn’t necessarily the right choice for a child. Skin is designed to sweat for several reasons, including regulating the temperature of our bodies. A child who is constantly running around all day playing needs sweat to ensure they don’t overheat. Blocking this natural bodily process, therefore, isn’t the best idea. It is wise to steer clear of antiperspirants and simply look for a deodorizing product that will eliminate body odor without stopping sweat.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2ZsrCwzquYp6yjYriqsNJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./brangelina-s-youngest-child-knox-jolie-pitt-is-destined-for-fame.html>&#171;&nbsp;Brangelinas Youngest Child Knox Jolie-Pitt Is Destined For Fame</a></div></section><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
