href=#><strong>Sia</strong></a> has cemented herself as the ultimate <a href=#>Survivor</a> superfan as she began the tradition of rewarding her favorite players with a generous donation.</p><p>The prize, which would later be dubbed the Sia Award by fans, began in 2016 during the Survivor: Kaôh Rōng&nbsp;finale. The Grammy winner was so impressed with finalist <strong>Tai Trang</strong> over his compassion for animals throughout the season that she felt compelled to reward him.</p><p>Over the years, Sia has given out more than $1 million to former Survivor players. The amount she gives to each contestant ranges from $14K to $100K. Sia has previously explained that she decided on $15K for most players because that was the most she could give them without them having to pay taxes on the gift.</p><p>While Sia hasn’t shared why she gives some players more money than others, longtime host <strong>Jeff Probst</strong> weighed in on why she enjoys spreading the wealth.</p><p>“Her thought is this, ‘I make a lot of money. I’ve been really lucky, and I want to share it with the people who entertain me and bring me joy.’ And one of those shows is Survivor,” Probst said during an August 2023 appearance on the <a href=#>Howard Stern Show</a>. “Our last season, I wake up at 7:45 the day after the finale aired, and Sia is calling me for like the ninth time, and I finally wake up and pick it up, and she goes, ‘I’m ready to give away money, can we get them on the phone?’ That’s how fast it happens.”</p><p>Years after the tradition began, Probst opened up about how he has helped facilitate Sia’s generosity over the years.</p><p>“Back when we did the live reunion shows, she would either be sitting in the audience or in my dressing room,” Probst explained to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in December 2022. “She would watch the finale and then let me know who she wanted to receive the Sia Award. The players would find out immediately. It was very powerful to see it go down.”</p><p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, Survivor began doing its aftershow in Fiji after crowning the season’s winner. Now, Sia watches the finale from home and texts Probst himself to get the contact information of the players she wants to reach out to.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see which Survivor players have won the Sia Award over the years:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Every-Survivor-Contestant-Who-Sia-Deemed-Her-Favorite-Player-and-Rewarded-Them-With-a-Cash-Prize-075-084.jpg><h3>Tai Trang</h3><p>Season: Kaôh Rōng</p><p>Amount: $50,000 and an additional $50,000 to the charity of his choice</p><p>Reason: Sia was impressed with the lengths Tai went to protect a chicken, whom he named Mark, from being eaten by his fellow tribemates.</p><h3>Donathan Hurley</h3><p>Season: Ghost Island</p><p>Amount: $14,000</p><p>Reason: Donathan was the underdog of the season for most fans, but what sold Sia was his heart-wrenching backstory.

Sia subsequently tweeted that if Joe cut off his hair and donated it to a children’s cancer wig-making charity, she would reward him with a cash prize.

Instead of taking the money for himself, he asked Sia if the donation could go to charity as well.</p><h3>Aurora McCreary</h3><p>Season: Edge of Extinction</p><p>Amount: $15,000</p><p>Reason: Sia was moved by Aurora’s backstory growing up as a kid in the foster care system.</p><h3>Rick Devens</h3><p>Season: Edge of Extinction</p><p>Amount: $100,000</p><p>Reason: Devens was a fan favorite on the season due to his charismatic personality and ability to win challenges.

She was ostracized from her tribe for taking Kellee’s side.</p><h3>Drea Wheeler</h3><p>Season: Survivor 42</p><p>Amount: $100,000</p><p>Reason: Drea became the first Sia Award winner in the new era of the reality series.

He later learned how to walk and eventually became a personal trainer.</p><h3>Owen Knight</h3><p>Season: Survivor 43</p><p>Amount: $50,000</p><p>Reason: Owen was the self-proclaimed Charlie Brown of the season. Sia saw a little bit of herself as she was rooting for the underdog.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Every-Survivor-Contestant-Who-Sia-Deemed-Her-Favorite-Player-and-Rewarded-Them-With-a-Cash-Prize-075-086.jpg><h3>Jesse Lopez</h3><p>Season: Survivor 43</p><p>Amount: $100,000</p><p>Reason: Jesse went from a previous gang member to a Ph.D. student and was the strategic mastermind of his season.
