Diddy returned the favor by giving Hylton her first solo project: styling <strong>Jodeci</strong> for his ‚ÄúGotta Love‚Äù music video.

During a 2017 appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>‚ÄúThe Premium Pete Show‚Äù</a> podcast, Hylton shared that she and Diddy broke up shortly after Justin‚Äôs arrival because the music mogul wasn‚Äôt ready to settle down as his career was starting to take off.</p><h3>2010</h3><p>The exes reunited to celebrate Justin‚Äôs 16th birthday. Diddy organized a star-studded bash in New York City for the occasion. The trio posed for a family picture on the red carpet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Diddy-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Misa-Hyltons-Relationship-Timeline-The-Way-They-Were-2.jpg><h3>2019</h3><p>Hylton attended Diddy‚Äôs 50th birthday celebration in Los Angeles.</p><h3>June 2023</h3><p>The fashion designer raised eyebrows after she posted a series of cryptic posts after Justin was arrested for a DUI. (Justin was booked with a misdemeanor and released on a $5,000 bond.)</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not protecting no one anymore, just my son üíØ,‚Äù she wrote via her Instagram Story at the time. ‚ÄúThe statement ‚Äòa fish rots from the head down‚Äô means that, in addition to being a major contributing factor in a family or organization‚Äôs success, leadership is also the root cause of its failure and demise. The Truth shall set you free.‚Äù</p><h3>March 2024</h3><p>When Diddy‚Äôs homes were <a href=#>raided by homeland security</a>, Justin and brother Christian were present for the investigation at their family‚Äôs Los Angeles home. Hylton spoke out against law enforcement and claimed they executed ‚Äúoverzealous and overtly militarized force.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>‚Äú[The force] used against my sons Justin and Christian is deplorable. If these were the sons of a non-Black celebrity, they would not have been handled with the same aggression,‚Äù she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> alongside footage from the incident. ‚ÄúThe attempt to humiliate and terrorize these innocent young BLACK MEN is despicable!‚Äù</p><h3>May 2024</h3><p>As Diddy‚Äôs legal troubles continued, a video of Diddy assaulting then-girlfriend <strong>Casandra ‚ÄúCassie‚Äù Ventura</strong> in 2016 surfaced. Hylton <a href=#>voiced her support for Cassie</a> at the time.</p><p>‚ÄúI am heartbroken that Cassie must relive the horror of her abuse, and my heart goes out to her. I know exactly how she feels, and through my empathy, it has triggered my own trauma,‚Äù Hylton wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. ‚ÄúThese young people were raised by women that want the best for them ‚Äî we put God and education first and have always been united in our mutual effort to support their dreams. Two of the youngest do not have their mother here and it has been our duty to support them. Their father needs help and I am praying that he truly does the personal work and receives it.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadoZSZxm6tzZ1knrBdora0rYyhsKWsn6PAbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2aroqWVobavsY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eddie-bernice-johnson-obituary.html>&#171;&nbsp;Eddie Bernice Johnson Obituary</a>
